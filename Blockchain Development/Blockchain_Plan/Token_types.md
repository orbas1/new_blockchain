# Token Types Catalog (Advanced Analysis)

## Abstract
This catalog classifies token types within the ecosystem, describing utility, governance, and compliance characteristics.

## 1. Native Protocol Token
- **Purpose:** Staking, transaction fees, governance.
- **Economic design:** Disinflationary issuance with fee burn.
- **Compliance:** Potential classification as commodity or utility token; requires legal analysis.

## 2. Governance Token
- **Purpose:** Voting rights, governance proposals, treasury management.
- **Mechanisms:** Quadratic voting, delegation, conviction voting.
- **Risks:** Regulatory scrutiny if governance confers profit rights.

## 3. Stablecoins
- **Types:** Fiat-backed, crypto-collateralized, algorithmic.
- **Use cases:** Payments, settlement, collateral for DeFi.
- **Risk mitigation:** Proof-of-reserve audits, diversification of collateral.

## 4. Asset-Backed Tokens
- **Examples:** Tokenized securities, commodities, real estate.
- **Compliance:** Requires security token frameworks, KYC/AML, custody arrangements.
- **Opportunities:** Access to new liquidity pools, fractional ownership.

## 5. Utility Tokens
- **Purpose:** Access to services (data oracles, storage, compute).
- **Design:** Burn-to-use models, staking for service quality guarantees.
- **Risks:** Need clear utility to avoid securities classification.

## 6. Reward Tokens
- **Purpose:** Incentivize participation (staking, liquidity, community contributions).
- **Mechanisms:** Emissions schedules, retroactive rewards.
- **Management:** Treasury oversight to prevent dilution.

## 7. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
- **Use cases:** Digital identity, intellectual property, collectibles.
- **Features:** Royalty enforcement, programmable metadata.
- **Challenges:** Valuation volatility, metadata persistence.

## 8. Compliance Tokens
- **Purpose:** Represent regulatory permissions, certifications, or access rights.
- **Mechanisms:** Verifiable credentials, revocation frameworks.
- **Benefits:** Streamline regulatory audits and access control.

## 9. Research Outlook
- Integrate soulbound credentials for compliance.
- Explore composable token baskets and index tokens.
- Develop standardized disclosure frameworks for token classifications.

# Token Types Overview

## 1. Native Protocol Token
- Powers staking, governance, fee payments, collateral for security guarantees.
- Often features inflation schedule balancing security budget vs. holder dilution.
- Requires robust monetary policy and transparency on treasury usage.

## 2. Utility Tokens
- Provide access to platform services (compute, storage, bandwidth) or discounted fees.
- Enable prioritization of resource usage; must avoid securities classification via clear utility.
- Consider burn/mint mechanics tied to platform usage metrics.

## 3. Governance Tokens
- Provide voting rights, delegation, proposal submission, committee membership.
- May accrue value through revenue sharing, buybacks, or treasury rights.
- Governance frameworks must handle voter apathy, delegation abuse, and regulatory scrutiny.

## 4. Stablecoins
- **Fiat-backed**: Custodial reserves; requires audits and regulatory compliance.
- **Crypto-collateralized**: Overcollateralization, liquidation engines (MakerDAO model).
- **Algorithmic**: Supply adjustments via seigniorage; higher risk profile.
- Evaluate peg stability, transparency, legal obligations, and integration with payment rails.

## 5. Security Tokens
- Represent equity, debt, or revenue-sharing instruments.
- Subject to securities regulations; demand KYC/AML, transfer restrictions, reporting.
- Implement compliance layers (transfer whitelists, jurisdiction filters).

## 6. Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokens
- Tokenized commodities, real estate, trade finance, carbon credits.
- Require custody, insurance, valuation oracles, legal agreements.
- Unlock institutional capital but raise regulatory and operational complexity.

## 7. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
- Unique digital assets; metadata-driven value; can include royalties.
- Applications: art, collectibles, gaming items, identity, intellectual property.
- Need storage solutions (IPFS/Arweave), authenticity verification, licensing frameworks.

## 8. Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)
- Non-transferable tokens encoding credentials, reputation, or achievements.
- Useful for Sybil resistance, governance weighting, compliance credentials.
- Must incorporate privacy controls (zero-knowledge attestations) and revocation policies.

## 9. Liquidity Provider (LP) Tokens
- Represent share of liquidity pool; entitle holder to fees and rewards.
- Used as collateral or voting power; needs dynamic valuation and risk management.
- Smart contracts should mitigate impermanent loss and liquidity fragmentation.

## 10. Derivative & Synthetic Tokens
- Synthetic assets tracking commodities, indices, volatility; options and futures tokens.
- Require robust oracle infrastructure, risk parameters, margining systems.
- Regulatory oversight (derivatives law) and counterparty risk management vital.

## 11. Carbon & Impact Tokens
- Represent carbon offsets, renewable energy certificates, impact metrics.
- Need measurement, reporting, verification (MRV) standards and third-party audits.
- Integrate with ESG reporting dashboards for validators and enterprises.

## 12. Cross-Chain Wrapped Tokens
- Bridged representations of assets from other chains using custodial or trust-minimized bridges.
- Security depends on bridge design (multi-sig, light-client, optimistic).
- Require risk disclosures, insurance pools, and monitoring for collateralization.

## 13. Community Incentive Tokens
- Reward participation (quests, bug bounties, content creation) via soulbound or fungible tokens.
- Encourage ecosystem growth; ensure anti-Sybil mechanisms and clear reward policies.

## 14. Research Opportunities
- Composable identity tokens combining privacy and verifiable credentials.
- Tokenization of subscription services with dynamic pricing and usage-based burns.
- Automated compliance modules for security/RWA tokens across jurisdictions.
- Mechanisms for cross-chain yield-bearing tokens with transparent risk disclosures.

## 9. ESG & Impact Tokens
- **Carbon reference tokens**: Represent verified carbon removal with governance ensuring permanence and additionality.
- **Social impact bonds**: Tokenized performance-based financing instruments with automated payout triggers.
- **Biodiversity credits**: Emerging class tied to conservation metrics with oracle-verified outcomes.

## 10. Adaptive Utility Tokens
- **Intent tokens**: Short-lived tokens encoding transaction intents; facilitate prioritized execution or cross-chain routing.
- **Access badges**: Non-transferable tokens granting tiered access to protocol features, analytics, or governance privileges.
- **Dynamic fee tokens**: Pegged to compute/storage usage, adjusting supply via algorithmic mechanisms.

## 11. Research Directions
- Legal classification studies for hybrid tokens spanning utility, governance, and real-world asset exposure.
- Token design experiments assessing user comprehension, gameability, and incentive alignment.
- Stress-testing redemption and collateralization mechanisms during market volatility.
## 9. Sustainability-Linked Tokens
1. **Carbon reduction tokens**
   - Represent verified carbon offsets tied to protocol activity; integrate automatic retirement.
2. **Green staking derivatives**
   - Liquid staking tokens with embedded ESG scoring reflecting validator sustainability metrics.
3. **Impact bonds**
   - Tokenized bonds funding regenerative projects; coupon payments linked to verified impact milestones.

## 10. Governance & Participation Tokens
1. **Quadratic voting tokens**
   - Support quadratic voting rights to reduce plutocracy; require sybil-resistant identity systems.
2. **Reputation-weighted tokens**
   - Combine token ownership with reputational metrics for voting power.
3. **Contributor badges**
   - Non-transferable tokens recognizing ecosystem contributions (code, research, community).

## 11. Cross-Chain Utility Tokens
1. **Bridge credit tokens**
   - Provide collateral for cross-chain bridge operations, with insurance functions.
2. **Universal access tokens**
   - Grant multi-chain service access (RPC, analytics) with dynamic pricing.
3. **Interoperability routing tokens**
   - Incentivize relayers to maintain cross-chain message integrity.

## 12. AI & Knowledge Economy Tokens
1. **Model access tokens**
   - Provide metered access to AI inference services with verifiable computation receipts.
2. **Data provenance tokens**
   - Represent ownership and licensing rights for datasets, including royalty distribution mechanisms.
3. **Collaborative research tokens**
   - Distribute governance power and revenue shares among research contributors across disciplines.

## 13. Compliance & Assurance Tokens
1. **Regulatory attestation tokens**
   - Issued by accredited auditors confirming compliance status; revocable upon breaches.
2. **Risk buffer tokens**
   - Serve as capital buffers for systemic risk events, redeemable when stability thresholds met.
3. **Consumer protection tokens**
   - Non-transferable claims providing restitution rights in case of service failures.

## 14. Sustainability & Social Impact Tokens
1. **Carbon sequestration credits**
   - Tokenize verifiable carbon removal outcomes with long-term monitoring obligations.
2. **Community dividend tokens**
   - Allocate protocol profits to local community treasuries tied to validator locations or user demographics.
3. **Disaster resilience tokens**
   - Fund rapid-response liquidity pools for disaster relief partners, governed via transparent criteria.

## 15. Restaking & Security Tokens
1. **Security derivative tokens**
   - Represent exposure to restaked validator services with programmable slashing propagation and insurance coverage.
2. **Watchdog tokens**
   - Grant rights and rewards to independent monitoring agents verifying validator behavior across chains.
3. **Resilience bond tokens**
   - Tokenized catastrophe bonds backing recovery funds triggered by consensus or bridge failures.

# Extra Feature Details (Doctoral-Level Specification)

## Abstract
This specification details candidate advanced features, including functional scope, architecture, dependencies, and research considerations.

## 1. Confidential Governance Module
- **Functionality:** Enable secret ballots with verifiable tallying using zk-SNARKs; support weighted voting and delegated governance.
- **Architecture:** Smart contracts orchestrating vote commitments, zero-knowledge proof verification, and tally aggregation.
- **Dependencies:** Trusted setup ceremonies (if SNARK), audit trail storage, governance dashboard.
- **Risks:** Proof system complexity, voter coercion mitigation.

## 2. Compliance Orchestrator
- **Functionality:** Enforce policy rules (KYC, AML, sanctions screening) via modular rule engine.
- **Architecture:** Policy DSL compiled into smart contract predicates; off-chain oracle network providing compliance attestations.
- **Dependencies:** Identity providers, legal advisory board, reporting pipelines.
- **Risks:** Jurisdictional divergence, privacy concerns.

## 3. Intent-Centric UX Layer
- **Functionality:** Translate user intents into optimal transactions, leveraging solver networks.
- **Architecture:** Intent gateway, solver marketplace, cryptographic settlement contracts ensuring fairness.
- **Dependencies:** AI/ML models for intent resolution, MEV-resistant ordering layer.
- **Risks:** Solver collusion, intent misinterpretation.

## 4. Sustainability Toolkit
- **Functionality:** Track validator energy usage, integrate carbon offsets, issue sustainability badges.
- **Architecture:** Telemetry ingestion service, carbon oracle, reward distribution contracts.
- **Dependencies:** Energy data providers, ESG auditors.
- **Risks:** Data authenticity, offset quality assurance.

## 5. Data Science Sandbox
- **Functionality:** Provide privacy-preserving analytics environment with differential privacy, secure enclaves, and synthetic data.
- **Architecture:** Secure computation platform (MPC/TEE), data access policies, audit logging.
- **Dependencies:** Institutional data partners, privacy regulators.
- **Risks:** Data leakage, computational overhead.

## 6. Real-World Asset Tokenization Suite
- **Functionality:** Tokenize assets with compliance workflows, oracle feeds, and risk scoring.
- **Architecture:** Smart contract templates, oracle adapter framework, compliance state machine.
- **Dependencies:** Custodians, legal agreements, oracle providers.
- **Risks:** Counterparty risk, regulatory changes.

## 7. AI Security Copilot
- **Functionality:** Detect anomalies, recommend incident response actions, and automate remediation with approvals.
- **Architecture:** ML pipelines, feature stores, integration with SIEM/SOAR systems.
- **Dependencies:** High-quality telemetry, human oversight committees.
- **Risks:** False positives/negatives, adversarial ML attacks.

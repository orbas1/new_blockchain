# Structural Pattern Comparison (Advanced Matrix)

## Abstract
This matrix evaluates structural patterns against key decision criteria. Scores 1-5 indicate relative suitability.

| Structure | Scalability | Security | Governance Flexibility | Compliance Readiness | Implementation Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|----------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|-------|
| Monolithic Chain | 2 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 | Simple but limited scalability. |
| Modular Chain | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | Flexible upgrades; requires robust interfaces. |
| Sharded Chain | 5 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 5 | Excellent throughput; complex coordination. |
| Layered (Rollups) | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | Scales via L2; relies on L1 security.
| Consortium Hub-and-Spoke | 3 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 3 | Strong compliance controls; governance heavy.
| Multi-Chain Federation | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | Balances autonomy with shared security.
| DAG-Based Structure | 5 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 5 | High throughput; regulatory clarity evolving.

## Insights
- Modular + Layered architecture offers best balance for open yet compliant ecosystems.
- Consortium hub can coexist with modular base to satisfy institutional requirements.
- DAG-based structures may serve specialized subnets once compliance frameworks mature.

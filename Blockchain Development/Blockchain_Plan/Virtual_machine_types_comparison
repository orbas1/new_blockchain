# Virtual Machine Comparison Matrix (Advanced Assessment)

## Abstract
The matrix compares VM candidates across critical evaluation criteria. Scores 1-5 denote relative suitability for institutional blockchain deployment.

| VM Type | Performance | Determinism Assurance | Security Posture | Developer Ecosystem | ZK-Friendliness | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-----------------------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------|
| EVM | 3 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 2 | Massive tooling but limited performance; probabilistic gas costs. |
| WASM VM | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | Versatile and performant; requires determinism guards. |
| MoveVM | 4 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 4 | Strong safety via resource types; smaller community. |
| eBPF VM | 5 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | High throughput; determinism enforcement challenging. |
| zkVM | 2 | 5 | 5 | 2 | 5 | Provides provable execution; prover cost high. |
| Custom DSL VM | 3 | 5 | 4 | 2 | 4 | Tailored semantics; requires investment in tooling and education. |

## Recommendation
- Adopt hybrid approach: WASM VM as primary execution target, Move-inspired DSL for safety, zkVM modules for verifiable off-chain computation.
- Invest in determinism verification frameworks and developer education.

# Layer-2 Function Inventory (Advanced Catalog)

## Abstract
This inventory enumerates Layer-2 functions required for a holistic scaling ecosystem.

## Functions
1. **Sequencing & Ordering** – Deterministic transaction ordering, MEV mitigation, batch formation.
2. **Proof Generation** – zk-SNARK/zk-STARK/interactive fraud proofs for validity/fraud detection.
3. **Data Availability Publishing** – Posting commitments and data chunks to Layer-1 or external DA layers.
4. **Bridging & Messaging** – Secure message passing between L2-L1 and cross-rollup interoperability.
5. **Liquidity Provisioning** – Liquidity hubs, cross-domain AMMs, canonical bridges.
6. **State Synchronization** – Efficient state updates and proofs for light clients and exchanges.
7. **Dispute Resolution** – Challenge protocols, arbitration logic, forced exit mechanisms.
8. **Governance Integration** – Policy synchronization between L1 and L2, including token voting.
9. **Compliance Controls** – Optional KYC gating, transaction monitoring, audit logging.
10. **Monitoring & Telemetry** – Performance metrics, proof latency tracking, sequencer health dashboards.
11. **Developer Tooling** – SDKs, testnets, debugging tools specialized for L2 environments.
12. **Economic Incentives** – Reward distribution for sequencers, verifiers, and watchdogs.
13. **Emergency Shutdown** – Safe fallback paths enabling users to exit to L1 during catastrophic events.

# Programming Language Options (Advanced Analysis)

## Abstract
This analysis evaluates language options for smart contract development, balancing safety, expressiveness, and ecosystem adoption.

| Language | Paradigm | Safety Features | Ecosystem Maturity | Interoperability | Notes |
|----------|----------|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|-------|
| Custom Resource-Oriented DSL | Resource-oriented, statically typed | Linear types, effect system, formal verification hooks | Emerging | High via compiler targets | Tailored for protocol; requires developer education. |
| Rust | Systems, statically typed | Ownership model, borrow checker, strong tooling | High | High (WASM) | Great for SDKs and high-assurance contracts. |
| TypeScript | Dynamic/Static (with types) | TypeScript type system, linting, runtime guards | Very high | Medium (via transpilers) | Excellent for front-end/integration developers. |
| Solidity | Contract-oriented | Modifier system, limited type safety | Very high | High (EVM) | Legacy compatibility; requires strict auditing. |
| Python (Restricted) | Dynamic | Type hints, static analyzers, sandboxing | High | Medium | Ideal for research and scripting with guardrails. |
| Move | Resource-oriented | Linear resources, formal semantics | Growing | Medium (MoveVM) | High safety; smaller ecosystem. |

## Recommendations
- Adopt custom DSL with Rust-based toolchain as primary; provide TypeScript/Rust SDKs for integration.
- Maintain Solidity transpiler for EVM interop.
- Offer Python sandbox for data science with strict runtime controls.

# Token Strategy Scoring Analysis (Advanced Assessment)

## Abstract
This analysis scores token strategy components across economic sustainability, governance alignment, and regulatory compliance. Scores 1-5 indicate strength; weights represent strategic importance.

| Component | Weight | Economic Sustainability | Governance Alignment | Regulatory Compliance | Weighted Score |
|-----------|--------|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| Native Token Monetary Policy | 0.25 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4.00 |
| Staking & Slashing Mechanisms | 0.20 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4.60 |
| Treasury & Public Goods Funding | 0.15 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4.35 |
| Stablecoin Framework | 0.15 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 4.05 |
| Liquidity Incentives | 0.10 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3.00 |
| Compliance Tokenization | 0.10 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4.05 |
| Real-World Asset Tokenization | 0.05 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 3.35 |

## Interpretation
- **Staking mechanisms** score highest due to direct impact on security and economic sustainability.
- **Treasury funding** strongly aligns governance incentives; requires transparency tooling.
- **Liquidity incentives** score lower, warranting cautious emissions to avoid dilution.

## Recommendations
- Implement adaptive monetary policy responding to staking participation metrics.
- Enhance compliance token framework with verifiable credentials.
- Allocate treasury budget for liquidity support targeted at strategic markets.

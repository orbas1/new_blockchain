# Token Design Scoring Analysis

Scoring criteria (1-5):
- **Utility Fit**
- **Economic Sustainability**
- **Regulatory Compliance**
- **Community Alignment**
- **Technical Complexity** (inverse score; higher means easier)

| Token Type | Utility Fit | Economic Sustainability | Regulatory Compliance | Community Alignment | Technical Complexity | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Native Protocol Token | 5 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 | Critical for security; needs transparent issuance and treasury use. |
| Utility Token | 4 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Ensure genuine utility to avoid securities risk. |
| Governance Token | 3 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 3 | Need safeguards against plutocracy; consider quadratic voting. |
| Stablecoin (Fiat-backed) | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 4 | Requires compliance with payment regulations and audits. |
| Stablecoin (Crypto-collateral) | 4 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 3 | Risk from collateral volatility; robust liquidation engine required. |
| Security Token | 3 | 4 | 1 | 2 | 2 | Heavy regulatory burden; suits institutional investors. |
| RWA Token | 4 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 2 | Complex legal/custody; high impact if executed well. |
| NFT | 3 | 3 | 3 | 5 | 4 | Strong community value; depends on IP management. |
| Soulbound Token | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 3 | Must address privacy and revocation for fairness. |
| LP Token | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 4 | Essential for DeFi; need risk disclosures. |
| Derivative Token | 4 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 2 | Complex risk; regulatory attention (derivatives law). |
| Carbon/Impact Token | 3 | 3 | 2 | 4 | 2 | Requires MRV standards; high reputational upside. |
| Wrapped Cross-Chain Token | 4 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 3 | Security dependent on bridge; require insurance/backstops. |
| Community Incentive Token | 3 | 3 | 2 | 5 | 4 | Effective for engagement; must mitigate Sybil attacks. |

## Insights
- Native token and LP tokens score highest for immediate utility and sustainability.
- Security and RWA tokens lag on compliance and complexity; require specialized infrastructure.
- Community tokens excel in alignment but need robust anti-Sybil measures.

## Recommendations
1. Anchor economy on native token + stablecoin pair for stability.
2. Introduce governance token with progressive decentralization and quadratic voting to protect minorities.
3. Deploy LP and incentive tokens with transparent rewards and risk dashboards.
4. Pursue RWA and impact tokens in phased pilots with strong legal counsel and MRV partners.

## Extended Scoring Criteria
| Dimension | Description | Weight |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Utility Diversity | Range of core use-cases supported (governance, fees, staking, access) | 20% |
| Economic Sustainability | Inflation control, sink mechanisms, treasury management | 20% |
| Regulatory Readiness | Compliance posture, KYC tooling, disclosure practices | 15% |
| User Adoption | Wallet distribution, exchange listings, community programs | 15% |
| Security & Risk | Custody best practices, slashing design, insurance coverage | 15% |
| ESG Alignment | Environmental impact reporting, social good programs | 15% |

## Analytical Workflow
1. Gather quantitative data (circulating supply, staking ratio, churn) and qualitative assessments (governance transparency).
2. Score tokens per dimension, document rationale, and capture evidence links.
3. Run scenario analysis adjusting weights for institutional vs. retail priorities.
4. Present findings to governance committees for iterative refinement and roadmap alignment.
## Extended Evaluation Metrics
| Dimension | Weight | Description | Measurement Approach |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sustainability Alignment | 0.10 | Degree to which token incentivizes environmentally responsible behavior | Carbon offsets retired, renewable validator participation |
| Community Participation | 0.10 | Engagement of token holders in governance, education, and public goods | Governance turnout, contribution tracking |
| Cross-Chain Utility | 0.10 | Token usability across multiple chains, bridges, and applications | Number of integrations, bridge volume |
| Compliance Readiness | 0.10 | Ability to meet regulatory obligations and provide audit trails | Availability of KYC hooks, reporting APIs |

### Scoring Enhancements
- Introduce **scenario-based stress scores** evaluating token performance during market shocks, regulatory changes, and technology upgrades.
- Incorporate **qualitative assessments** from expert panels to contextualize quantitative scores.
- Maintain **data lineage** ensuring all scoring metrics trace back to verifiable on-chain or audited off-chain data.

### Governance Recommendations
- Publish quarterly scoring updates with methodology changes, sensitivity analysis, and action items.
- Provide open-source tooling for community members to run independent scoring simulations and challenge assumptions.
## Advanced Scenario Modeling
- **Macro stress tests**: Evaluate token resilience under liquidity crunches, interest rate shifts, and macroeconomic downturns.
- **Policy shocks**: Simulate regulatory actions (securities classification, tax changes) and measure impact on utility and demand.
- **Technology shifts**: Assess how protocol upgrades, L2 migrations, or new competitors affect scoring dimensions.

## Data Governance Framework
1. Define data quality standards (accuracy, timeliness, completeness) for inputs feeding scoring models.
2. Establish audit trails capturing transformations, assumptions, and reviewer approvals.
3. Implement privacy safeguards for sensitive off-chain data using differential privacy or access controls.

## Stakeholder Engagement Plan
- Conduct workshops with validators, users, regulators, and developers to review scoring outcomes and gather feedback.
- Publish plain-language summaries alongside technical appendices to ensure broad accessibility.
- Offer open APIs enabling community dashboards, research projects, and accountability tools leveraging scoring data.

## Continuous Improvement Loop
1. Track predictive power of scoring metrics against real-world outcomes (network outages, governance stalemates, adoption trends).
2. Retire or recalibrate metrics that show low correlation or unintended incentives.
3. Commission external academic reviews biennially to challenge methodologies and incorporate emerging best practices.

## Scenario-Specific Weighting Guide
| Scenario | Weight Adjustments | Focus Dimensions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Institutional onboarding | Increase Compliance Readiness to 0.18, reduce Community Participation to 0.06 | Compliance, Sustainability, Liquidity |
| Sustainability campaign | Increase Sustainability Alignment to 0.20, reduce Cross-Chain Utility to 0.05 | Environmental metrics, Community Participation |
| Innovation push | Increase Research & Development to 0.15, reduce Liquidity to 0.08 | Developer adoption, Governance agility |
| Crisis recovery | Increase Resilience to 0.18, reduce Growth Potential to 0.07 | Treasury buffers, Governance responsiveness |

## Research Agenda
- Develop predictive models linking token scoring dimensions to future validator participation and network security metrics.
- Explore sentiment analysis on governance forums and social channels to augment Community Participation scoring.
- Investigate sustainability impact accounting frameworks to verify claimed environmental benefits.
- Benchmark scoring methodology against external indices (Messari, Electric Capital) to calibrate differences.

## Operationalization Checklist
- Automate data ingestion with validation checks, anomaly detection, and alerting when KPIs deviate from baselines.
- Maintain reviewer rotation policies to prevent capture and ensure diverse perspectives in scoring committees.
- Publish open-source scoring calculators allowing stakeholders to experiment with custom weightings.
- Align scoring review schedule with governance cycles to inform policy decisions and treasury allocations.

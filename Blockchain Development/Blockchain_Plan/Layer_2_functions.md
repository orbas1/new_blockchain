# Layer-2 Functional Blueprint (Advanced Decomposition)

## Abstract
This document articulates the mission-critical functions of the Layer-2 (L2) ecosystem surrounding the base chain. It outlines architectural responsibilities, security assurances, and interoperability frameworks enabling scalable throughput while preserving decentralization.

## 1. L2 Taxonomy
- **Optimistic rollups:** Fraud-proof oriented with challenge windows, leveraging interactive verification games.
- **Zero-knowledge rollups:** Validity proof driven using zk-SNARKs/zk-STARKs for immediate finality.
- **State channels & payment channels:** Off-chain bilateral/multilateral agreements with periodic settlement on L1.
- **Sidechains & appchains:** Sovereign chains anchored via trust-minimized bridges.

## 2. Core Functions
1. **Scalability Provisioning**
   - Aggregation of transactions into batches, compressing data via recursive proofs.
   - Deterministic sequencing to prevent MEV exploitation; managed by sequencer committees with rotation policy.
2. **Security Anchoring**
   - Posting commitments (state roots, proof artifacts) to L1 along with economic collateral.
   - Watchtower network monitors for malicious proofs or censorship, triggering disputes.
3. **Interoperability & Settlement**
   - Standardized messaging protocol (IBC derivatives) for asset transfers, cross-domain calls, and shared security features.
   - Atomic composability achieved through asynchronous message receipts with bounded finality windows.
4. **Liquidity Management**
   - Native liquidity hubs and automated market makers bridging L1/L2 assets.
   - Incentive programs (liquidity mining, fee rebates) encouraging deep pools and reduced slippage.

## 3. Operational Considerations
- **Sequencer decentralization:** Progressive decentralization via proof-of-authority to proof-of-stake transitions; includes consensus overlays for fairness.
- **Data availability:** Use of L1 DA layer augmented with data availability sampling networks; fallback to external DA (Celestia-style) when cost-effective.
- **Fee economics:** Dynamic fee model aligning L2 operating costs with L1 posting fees; integrates congestion prediction models.

## 4. Developer Toolchain
- Unified APIs enabling contract deployment to L2 with compatibility layers translating L1 bytecode.
- Cross-domain SDKs for bridging, message relaying, and liquidity management, accompanied by simulation harnesses.
- Observability dashboards exposing throughput, proof latency, dispute frequency, and sequencer health metrics.

## 5. Governance & Compliance
- L2 governance tokens integrate with L1 governance for policy synchronization.
- Compliance modules allow optional KYC gating for enterprise rollups, ensuring privacy-preserving regulatory reporting.
- Incident response framework covering forced exits, censorship resistance strategies, and sequencer accountability.

## 6. Research Roadmap
- Investigation into shared prover infrastructure to amortize zk-proof costs via hardware acceleration clusters.
- Exploration of decentralized sequencer marketplaces with cryptographic sortition and verifiable quality-of-service scores.
- Development of cross-rollup composability primitives leveraging asynchronous IBC and light-client proofs.

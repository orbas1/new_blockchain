# Reward Models Comparative Matrix (Advanced Evaluation)

## Abstract
The following matrix evaluates major reward models across quantitative and qualitative criteria. Scores range 1 (low alignment) to 5 (excellent alignment) based on economic modeling and expert judgment.

| Reward Model | Security Budget Stability | Incentive Alignment | Governance Flexibility | Implementation Complexity | Notes |
|--------------|--------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------|
| Fixed Inflation | 3 | 2 | 4 | 2 | Simple but risks under-staking if yields unattractive. |
| Dynamic Inflation (Target Staking) | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | Feedback control maintains target participation; requires calibration. |
| Auction-Based Block Rights | 4 | 3 | 2 | 4 | Efficient allocation but susceptible to collusion; needs robust auctions. |
| Performance-Weighted Rewards | 4 | 5 | 3 | 3 | Encourages uptime/quality; must prevent gaming of metrics. |
| Reputation-Enhanced Rewards | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | Integrates audits/community input; data quality critical. |
| Liquidity Mining Incentives | 2 | 4 | 5 | 3 | Boosts DeFi adoption; sustainability depends on treasury capacity. |
| Sustainability Bonuses | 3 | 3 | 4 | 2 | Aligns ESG goals; metrics need verification. |
| Quadratic Public Goods Allocation | 2 | 5 | 5 | 4 | Maximizes community alignment; complex funding mechanisms. |
| AI-Evaluated Impact Rewards | 4 | 4 | 3 | 5 | Promising but demands explainable AI and governance oversight. |

## Methodology
- Derived from economic simulations, Monte Carlo modeling, and stakeholder surveys.
- Implementation complexity accounts for engineering effort, data requirements, and governance overhead.
- Governance flexibility measures ability to adjust parameters without disrupting network stability.

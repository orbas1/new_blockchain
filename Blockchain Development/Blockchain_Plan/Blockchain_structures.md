# Blockchain Structural Patterns (Advanced Catalog)

## Abstract
This document catalogs structural patterns for blockchain networks, detailing architectural arrangements, governance models, and deployment strategies.

## 1. Monolithic Chain
- Single ledger handling consensus, execution, and data availability.
- Simplicity but limited scalability; best for tightly scoped applications.

## 2. Modular Chain
- Separation of consensus, execution, and data availability into distinct components.
- Enables specialization and independent scaling; requires standardized interfaces.

## 3. Sharded Chain
- Network split into shards with cross-shard communication protocols.
- Offers horizontal scalability; demands sophisticated routing and data availability.

## 4. Layered Architecture
- Base layer provides security and settlement; upper layers handle execution (rollups) or specialized services.
- Balances security with scalability, fosters ecosystem diversity.

## 5. Consortium Hub-and-Spoke
- Central hub chain coordinating multiple permissioned spokes operated by institutions.
- Ensures compliance and governance while enabling interoperability.

## 6. Multi-Chain Federation
- Independent chains share security via shared validator sets or cross-staking.
- Supports jurisdiction-specific chains while maintaining overarching security guarantees.

## 7. DAG-Based Structure
- Transactions form DAG rather than strict linear blocks.
- Useful for high-throughput IoT or micro-transaction systems; consensus proofs still evolving.

## 8. Research Opportunities
- Explore dynamic reconfiguration between monolithic and modular modes based on load.
- Investigate cross-structure interoperability frameworks using standard proofs.
- Model socio-economic impacts of structural choices on decentralization and governance.

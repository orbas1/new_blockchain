# Reward Model Catalog (Advanced Enumeration)

## Abstract
This catalog enumerates reward mechanisms applicable to validators, delegators, and ecosystem contributors. It documents economic rationale, incentive alignment, and implementation considerations.

## 1. Staking Reward Models
- **Fixed inflation:** Constant issuance rate, simple to communicate but susceptible to dilution if staking ratio low.
- **Dynamic inflation:** Adjusts rewards based on target staking ratio; uses feedback control to maintain security budget.
- **Auction-based rewards:** Validators bid for block production rights; revenue redistributed to stakers.

## 2. Performance-Based Rewards
- **Uptime weighting:** Rewards scaled by validator availability and latency metrics.
- **Quality-of-service metrics:** Includes responsiveness to network requests, accurate data availability proofs, and compliance with upgrade schedules.
- **Reputation-enhanced rewards:** Incorporates external audits and community ratings into weighting.

## 3. Contribution Rewards
- **Development grants:** Tokens awarded for code contributions, bug fixes, and tooling.
- **Research bounties:** Incentivize academic-grade analyses, security proofs, and benchmarking studies.
- **Community engagement:** Rewards for education, content creation, and user support.

## 4. Liquidity & DeFi Incentives
- **Liquidity mining:** AMM liquidity providers receive reward emissions proportional to contribution.
- **Derivatives staking:** Liquid staking token holders earn additional yield from DeFi protocols.
- **Insurance underwriting:** Capital providers to insurance pools receive premiums and rewards.

## 5. Environmental & Social Rewards
- **Sustainability bonuses:** Validators meeting energy efficiency standards earn supplementary rewards.
- **Public goods funding:** Participation in quadratic funding or retroactive funding yields recognition tokens.
- **Diversity incentives:** Programs incentivizing geographic and demographic diversity within validator set.

## 6. Future Concepts
- **AI-evaluated rewards:** Machine learning models allocate rewards based on holistic impact scores.
- **Cross-chain reward sharing:** Validators operating multi-chain infrastructure receive composite incentives.
- **Dynamic bonding curves:** Reward rates modulated by token bonding curves tied to risk metrics.

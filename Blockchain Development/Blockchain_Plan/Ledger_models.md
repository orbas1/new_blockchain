# Ledger Models Catalog (Advanced Analysis)

## Abstract
This catalog explores ledger models and their applicability to institutional blockchain deployments. It covers data structures, privacy characteristics, and interoperability features.

## 1. Append-Only Log Ledger
- **Description:** Simple log of transactions; state derived via replay.
- **Advantages:** High auditability, minimal complexity.
- **Challenges:** Replay cost, state reconstruction overhead.

## 2. UTXO Model
- **Description:** Assets represented as unspent transaction outputs; transactions consume and create outputs.
- **Advantages:** Intrinsic parallelism, easier privacy management via coin mixing.
- **Challenges:** Complex smart contract programmability, limited expressiveness.

## 3. Account/State Model
- **Description:** Accounts maintain balances and storage; transactions mutate state directly.
- **Advantages:** Supports rich smart contracts, easier composability.
- **Challenges:** Requires access list/nonce management to prevent conflicts.

## 4. Hybrid Account-UTXO Model
- **Description:** Combines account-based contracts with UTXO privacy sets.
- **Advantages:** Balance between programmability and privacy.
- **Challenges:** Complexity in state synchronization, bridging between subsystems.

## 5. DAG-Based Ledger
- **Description:** Transactions form directed acyclic graph (DAG) rather than linear chain.
- **Advantages:** High throughput, parallel validation.
- **Challenges:** Consensus complexity, security proofs still maturing.

## 6. Partitioned/Sharded Ledger
- **Description:** Ledger split into shards with cross-shard communication protocols.
- **Advantages:** Horizontal scalability, localized state management.
- **Challenges:** Cross-shard consistency, data availability.

## 7. Confidential Ledgers
- **Description:** Uses zero-knowledge proofs or secure enclaves to hide transaction details.
- **Advantages:** Compliance with privacy requirements, enterprise adoption.
- **Challenges:** Computational overhead, proof complexity.

## 8. Research Agenda
- Evaluate hybrid ledger viability with Verkle tree commitments.
- Investigate cross-ledger atomic swaps using HTLCs and zk-proofs.
- Collaborate on standards for ledger interoperability (ISO/TC 307).

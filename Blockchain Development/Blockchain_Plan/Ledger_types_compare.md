# Ledger Types Comparison Matrix (Advanced Assessment)

## Abstract
This matrix compares ledger types across evaluation criteria significant for institutional deployment. Scores 1-5 indicate relative suitability.

| Ledger Type | Programmability | Privacy | Scalability | Auditability | Implementation Complexity | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|-------------|--------------|---------------------------|-------|
| Append-Only Log | 2 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 2 | Simple but limited smart contract support. |
| UTXO | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | Good privacy via coin control; limited programmability. |
| Account/State | 5 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 4 | Highly programmable; requires robust state management. |
| Hybrid Account-UTXO | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | Complex but balances privacy and programmability. |
| DAG Ledger | 4 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 4 | High throughput; proofs and tooling still maturing. |
| Sharded Ledger | 5 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 5 | Excellent scalability; cross-shard complexity. |
| Confidential Ledger | 3 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 4 | Meets privacy needs; computationally intensive.

## Conclusion
- Hybrid account-UTXO approach offers strong balance for privacy-sensitive institutions willing to manage complexity.
- Sharded account ledgers essential for scaling but require rigorous cross-shard protocols.
- Confidential overlays can be layered atop other types for targeted privacy.

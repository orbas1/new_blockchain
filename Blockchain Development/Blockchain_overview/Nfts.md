# Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

## Standards
- Core metadata schema with on-chain/off-chain storage pointers.
- Royalty enforcement via metadata fields and marketplace compliance.
- Multi-asset NFTs supporting composability (ERC-1155 analogue).

## Use Cases
- Digital art, collectibles, and cultural artifacts.
- Real-world asset tokenization (titles, deeds, certifications).
- Gaming items, metaverse wearables, virtual land.
- Access control tokens for events, gated communities.

## Technical Considerations
- Metadata integrity (IPFS, Arweave, decentralized storage).
- Fractionalization via wrapper contracts.
- Soulbound constraints for non-transferable credentials.

## Market Infrastructure
- Auction formats (English, Dutch, sealed bid).
- Secondary market royalties distribution.
- Compliance modules for AML, sanctioned addresses.

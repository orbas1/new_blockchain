# Governance Framework

## Principles
- Transparency, accountability, inclusivity across stakeholders.
- Balance on-chain decision-making with off-chain advisory councils.

## Governance Bodies
- Token holder assembly with delegated voting.
- Technical council for protocol upgrades.
- Compliance committee overseeing regulatory alignment.
- Community treasury board managing grants and ecosystem growth.

## Processes
- Proposal lifecycle: draft → community review → temperature check → formal vote → implementation.
- Quorum and supermajority thresholds vary by proposal type (parameter tweak vs. hard fork).
- Emergency powers with sunset clauses for incident response.

## Tooling
- Governance portal with discussion forums, snapshot voting, quadratic voting options.
- Identity systems for sybil resistance (proof-of-personhood, credential gating).
- Analytics for voter participation, delegation network health, proposal impact.

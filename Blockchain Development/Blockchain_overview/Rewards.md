# Rewards Framework

## Reward Sources
- Block proposal rewards and transaction fees.
- MEV redistribution through auctions or PBS revenue sharing.
- Inflationary issuance directed to validators, delegators, ecosystem funds.

## Allocation Models
- Proportional to stake with performance multipliers.
- Tiered incentives for infrastructure contributions (oracle operators, relayers).
- Quadratic funding for community initiatives funded from treasury.

## Distribution Controls
- Auto-compounding vs. manual claim.
- Delegation splits between validator and delegators with configurable commission.
- Transparency dashboards showing reward history and APY.

## Sustainability
- Balance security budget with monetary inflation.
- Introduce burn mechanisms to offset issuance (EIP-1559 style).
- Periodic governance reviews of reward parameters.

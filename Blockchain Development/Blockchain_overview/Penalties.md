# Penalty & Slashing Framework

## 1. Objectives
- Deter malicious behavior, compensate victims, and maintain liveness.

## 2. Penalty Types
- Minor faults (downtime) with proportional fines or reward withholding.
- Severe faults (double-sign, safety violations) leading to stake destruction.
- Governance offences (vote manipulation, collusion) with social slashing.

## 3. Process
- Evidence submission, automated verification, appeals pipeline, restitution distribution.
- Insurance and staking derivatives hedging slashing risk.

## 4. Research Agenda
- Mechanism design for collusion-resistant penalty schedules.
- Risk transfer markets (slashing insurance, CDS).
- Dynamic penalty adjustments using observed network conditions.

# Finalization Mechanics

## Objectives
- Provide irreversible confirmation that blocks cannot be reverted without slashing substantial stake or incurring prohibitive cost.

## Approaches
- **Probabilistic Finality**: Longest-chain protocols with diminishing reorg probability after N confirmations.
- **Deterministic Finality**: BFT commits where quorum signatures seal blocks (e.g., Tendermint, GRANDPA).
- **Hybrid**: Chain-based proposals with finality gadget overlays.

## Instrumentation
- Finality lag metrics (latest finalized height vs. head).
- Alerts for stalled finality and conflicting votes.
- Visualization of validator participation in commit rounds.

## Governance Integration
- Emergency override processes to address catastrophic bugs with transparent stakeholder voting.
- Economic insurance funds to compensate impacted users during rare reorg events.

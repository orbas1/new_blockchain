# Python Library Ecosystem

## Node Interaction
- `web3.py` for JSON-RPC communication and contract bindings.
- `py-substrate-interface` for Substrate-based chains.
- `cosmpy` for Cosmos SDK networks.

## Cryptography & Encoding
- `pycryptodome` for symmetric/asymmetric primitives.
- `eth-keys`, `nacl`, `blspy` for signature schemes.
- `pymerkletools`, `merkly` for Merkle tree operations.

## Data & Analytics
- `pandas` for data analysis.
- `networkx` for graph analysis of peer topology.
- `matplotlib`, `plotly` for visualization dashboards.

## Testing & Simulation
- `pytest` with `hypothesis` for property-based testing.
- `brownie`, `apeworx`, `foundry` Python bindings for smart contract testing.
- `simpy` for discrete-event network simulations.

## DevOps
- `fabric`, `invoke` for deployment scripts.
- `ansible` modules for infrastructure automation.

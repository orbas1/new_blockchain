# Smart Contracts

## Principles
- Deterministic execution, publicly verifiable results.
- Upgradeability balanced with immutability (proxy patterns, timelocks, governance approvals).

## Lifecycle
1. Design & specification with formal models and threat assessments.
2. Implementation with secure coding guidelines (reentrancy guards, overflow checks).
3. Audit and formal verification.
4. Deployment and on-chain monitoring (event logs, anomaly detection).
5. Maintenance via governance-driven upgrades.

## Standards
- Token interfaces (ERC-20/721/1155 analogs).
- Governance modules (voting, delegation, quorum calculation).
- Cross-chain messaging adapters.

## Developer Tooling
- SDKs, language support (Solidity, Move, Rust, Sway).
- Test frameworks (Hardhat, Foundry, Anchor) integrated with CI.
- Static and dynamic analysis (Slither, Echidna, Manticore).

## Compliance & Risk
- Documentation for regulatory review.
- Kill switches for high-risk modules with transparent procedures.
- Insurance pools and bug bounty programs.

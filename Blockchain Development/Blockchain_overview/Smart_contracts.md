# Smart Contract Engineering

## 1. Lifecycle
- Specification, formal modelling, development, audit, deployment, monitoring, upgrade.

## 2. Design Principles
- Modular architecture, upgradeable proxies with governance safeguards.
- Defense-in-depth: access controls, rate limits, invariant checks.
- Gas efficiency through precomputations, storage packing, and caching.

## 3. Tooling
- DSLs (Move, Solidity, Rust-based frameworks) with linting and static analysis (Slither, Securify, Manticore).
- Formal verification (Coq, Dafny, Certora).
- Runtime monitoring (Forta-like agents, transaction simulators).

## 4. Compliance
- Embed legal agreements via Ricardian contracts.
- Provide audit logs, on-chain metadata, and upgrade notices.

## 5. Research Agenda
- Intent-based architectures decoupling user goals from execution paths.
- Autonomous agent frameworks using reinforcement learning with safety constraints.
- Privacy-preserving smart contracts via multi-party computation and zero-knowledge.

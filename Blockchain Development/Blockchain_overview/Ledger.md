# Ledger Architecture (Doctoral Expansion)

## 1. Conceptual Model
The ledger is a tamper-evident sequence of state transitions produced by the consensus engine. It combines transactional semantics, cryptographic commitments, and archival guarantees. An institutional deployment must treat the ledger as both a compliance artifact and a real-time operational database.

## 2. Data Structures
- **Block header:** Contains merkleized commitments to transactions, state roots, receipts, and metadata (gas metrics, proposer ID).
- **State representation:** Sparse Merkle or Verkle trees with versioned nodes to enable light-client proofs and partial state queries.
- **Receipt index:** Secondary structures (Bloom filters, binary Patricia tries) to accelerate event queries and analytics.
- **Historical archive:** Cold storage shards anchored via periodic checkpoint hashes and notarized on external chains or public logs.

## 3. Invariants
- **Append-only ordering** enforced via consensus certificates and cryptographic hashes.
- **Consistency** meaning each prefix defines a valid state machine execution; invalid transitions are rejected at execution time.
- **Auditability** through deterministic replay, cryptographic proofs, and human-readable trace reconstruction.

## 4. Operations Lifecycle
1. **Ingestion:** Transactions enter mempools with pre-validation (signature, nonce, fee).
2. **Execution:** Deterministic state transition function applies business logic while generating logs/events.
3. **Commit:** Post-state root hashed into header; receipts persisted; telemetry emitted.
4. **Archival:** Snapshots taken at governance-defined cadence, pushed to redundant storage providers with hash attestations.

## 5. Quality Attributes
- **Immutability assurance:** Multi-party notarization, tamper-detection alarms, and cryptographic time-stamping.
- **Queryability:** Support GraphQL/SQL gateways with materialized views and zero-knowledge read privacy extensions.
- **Performance:** Storage-tier benchmarking, caching of frequently accessed trie nodes, and asynchronous pruning.

## 6. Compliance & Governance
- Maintain retention schedules aligned with jurisdictional mandates (e.g., MiFID II, HIPAA).
- Provide selective disclosure via view keys and confidential logging for regulated entities.
- Record governance votes, parameter changes, and upgrade metadata as first-class ledger events.

## 7. Research Roadmap
- Explore recursive SNARK proofs for full-ledger verification.
- Investigate verifiable database techniques (certified B-trees) for analytics layers.
- Prototype differential privacy over ledger-derived datasets for ecosystem reporting.

# Ledger Architecture

## Conceptual Model
- Append-only replicated state machine capturing balances, smart contract storage, and protocol metadata.
- Partitioned into blocks containing ordered transactions, state roots, and cryptographic commitments.

## Data Structures
- **Account-Based**: Maintains balances and nonce; simpler for smart contracts, requires replay protection.
- **UTXO-Based**: Tracks unspent outputs; enables parallelism and privacy via coin selection.
- **Hybrid Models**: Employ accounts for smart contracts and UTXOs for payments (e.g., Nervos CKB).
- **State Trees**: Merkle Patricia Tries, Sparse Merkle Trees, Verkle Trees for scalable proofs.

## Ledger State Components
- Token balances, staking positions, governance votes.
- Smart contract bytecode and storage slots.
- Validator metadata: reputation, jail status, slashing history.
- Off-chain commitments: rollup state roots, oracle feeds, verifiable randomness beacons.

## Synchronization Modes
- Full nodes: download and validate entire history.
- Pruned nodes: retain recent state plus checkpoints.
- Light clients: verify headers and inclusion proofs via succinct proofs (SNARK/STARK, FlyClient).

## Compliance & Auditability
- Maintain audit trails with deterministic indexing of transactions and events.
- Support data retention policies and privacy redaction through selective disclosure (zero-knowledge proofs, view keys).

## Scalability Roadmap
- Introduce stateless client research (witness availability, code Merkleization).
- Explore data availability sampling and erasure coding for light client security.
- Evaluate block archival strategies: decentralized storage (IPFS/Filecoin) and institutional archives.

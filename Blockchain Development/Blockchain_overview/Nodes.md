# Node Roles

## Types
- **Full Nodes**: Validate blocks, maintain full state, serve RPC endpoints.
- **Validator Nodes**: Participate in consensus, produce blocks, sign votes.
- **Archive Nodes**: Retain entire history for analytics and compliance.
- **Light Clients**: Verify proofs using minimal resources.
- **Observer Nodes**: Monitor network for MEV, security anomalies.

## Operational Requirements
- Hardware specs by role (CPU, RAM, storage, bandwidth).
- Security hardening: firewalls, key management, intrusion detection.
- Monitoring: metrics collection, log aggregation, alerting.

## Deployment Models
- On-premise data centers, cloud infrastructure, hybrid setups.
- Kubernetes orchestration for scaling RPC services.
- Geo-distribution to minimize latency and regulatory concentration.

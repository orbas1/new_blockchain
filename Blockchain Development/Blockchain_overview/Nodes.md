# Node Topology

## 1. Node Types
- Full nodes, archival nodes, light clients, validator nodes, witness nodes.

## 2. Infrastructure
- Hardware profiles, virtualization, containerization, bare-metal setups.
- Geo-distribution strategies for resilience.

## 3. Operations
- Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana), log aggregation, auto-recovery.
- Security (firewalls, DDoS mitigation, HSM integration).

## 4. Research Agenda
- Decentralized node marketplaces.
- Energy-aware scheduling and renewable integration.
- Automated compliance reporting for regulated nodes.

# Reward Timing

## Concepts
- Defines cadence for distributing validator/miner rewards.
- Impacts compounding yield, liquidity, and security responsiveness.

## Options
- Per-block payouts with immediate crediting.
- Epoch-based distribution aligning with finality checkpoints.
- Deferred vesting with lockups to discourage short-term attacks.

## Considerations
- Balance between frequent payouts (better cash flow) and gas efficiency.
- Handling slashing deductions before disbursement.
- Accounting standards for treasury reporting.

# Reward Timing Analysis

## 1. Emission Cadence
- Block-level rewards vs epoch-based payouts.
- Deferred distribution to allow slashing adjudication.
- Streaming rewards for real-time accrual (continuous compounding).

## 2. Economic Considerations
- Align reward timing with validator cash-flow needs and tax obligations.
- Smooth issuance to prevent supply shocks.
- Incentivize long-term staking via vesting multipliers.

## 3. Implementation
- On-chain reward accumulator contracts with precise accounting.
- Retroactive adjustments for missed attestations or penalties.
- Transparent dashboards for validator accounting.

## 4. Research Directions
- Predictive models adjusting cadence based on network health.
- Cross-chain synchronization of reward epochs for shared security systems.
- Integration with real-world asset yields (staking-as-a-service).

# API Strategy

## Objectives
- Provide secure, scalable interfaces for wallets, explorers, dApps, and analytics platforms.

## API Types
- JSON-RPC for low-level node interactions.
- REST/GraphQL endpoints for aggregated data.
- WebSocket streams for real-time events.
- gRPC interfaces for high-performance internal services.

## Security & Governance
- API key management, rate limiting, and quotas.
- Role-based access control for privileged endpoints.
- Audit logging and anomaly detection.

## Documentation & Developer Experience
- Auto-generated OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas.
- SDKs in major languages (TypeScript, Python, Rust).
- Sandbox/testnet environments with sample data.

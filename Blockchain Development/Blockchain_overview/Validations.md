# Validation Workflow

## 1. Pre-Validation
- Signature verification, nonce checks, access list enforcement.

## 2. Execution Validation
- Deterministic state transition, gas metering, error handling.

## 3. Post-Validation
- State root consistency, receipts generation, event emission.

## 4. Tooling
- Validation sandboxes, fuzzers, concolic testers.
- Cross-client differential testing (Hive-style).

## 5. Research Agenda
- Formal verification of validation logic.
- Hardware acceleration for signature verification.

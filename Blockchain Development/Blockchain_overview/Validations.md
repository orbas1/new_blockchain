3. Execute transactions deterministically.
4. Validate receipts, logs, and emitted events.
5. Update state root and compare with block header.
6. Record validator attestations and signatures.

## Validator Responsibilities
- Maintain high uptime and secure key management.
- Participate in consensus voting and finality.
- Provide proofs for light clients.

## Tooling
- Validation clients with modular components.
- Fuzz testing frameworks to uncover consensus bugs.
- Attestation aggregation services.

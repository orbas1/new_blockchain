# Virtual Machine Strategy (Doctoral Expansion)

## 1. Design Goals
- Deterministic execution across heterogeneous hardware.
- Safety through memory isolation, resource metering, and formal verification.
- Developer ergonomics with rich tooling and language support.

## 2. Architecture
- WASM core with capability-based security model.
- Gas metering tied to CPU, memory, and I/O.
- Precompiles for cryptography, big integers, zk-proof verification.

## 3. Execution Pipeline
- Bytecode validation, instrumentation for gas accounting.
- JIT/AOT compilation with deterministic outputs.
- Parallel execution scheduler using access lists and conflict detection.

## 4. Toolchain
- Compilers (Rust, AssemblyScript, Go), debugging (GDB integration, tracers).
- Formal verification frameworks (K-framework, Move Prover).
- Testing harnesses: property-based fuzzing, concolic execution.

## 5. Research Agenda
- zkVM integration for verifiable off-chain execution.
- Homomorphic encryption support for confidential smart contracts.
- Adaptive resource pricing via on-chain machine learning.

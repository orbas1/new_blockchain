# Virtual Machine Overview

## Execution Model
- Deterministic state transitions with gas metering for resource accounting.
- Support for both low-level bytecode and high-level language compilers.

## Features
- Modular opcode set with versioning for backward compatibility.
- Precompiles for cryptographic operations (hashing, signature verification, pairings).
- Access to system contracts for staking, governance, and cross-chain messaging.

## Performance Enhancements
- JIT/AOT compilation for popular contracts.
- Parallel execution using dependency graphs and optimistic concurrency control.
- Deterministic sandboxing with WASM runtime support.

## Security Controls
- Formal verification frameworks (K, Coq, Move Prover).
- Gas schedule audits to prevent DoS vectors.
- Resource limits per transaction and per block.

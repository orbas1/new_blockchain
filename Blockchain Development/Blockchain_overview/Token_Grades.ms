# Token Grading Methodology

## 1. Evaluation Axes
- **Utility Realization:** Degree to which the token delivers promised functionality.
- **Economic Sustainability:** Revenue capture, cost structure, inflation control.
- **Governance Quality:** Transparency, decentralization, dispute resolution.
- **Security & Compliance:** Audit history, regulatory posture, custody resilience.
- **Adoption Metrics:** User base growth, integrations, network effects.

## 2. Scoring Model
- Weighted multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA).
- Combine quantitative data (on-chain metrics) with expert surveys.
- Normalize scores 0-5, compute composite grade (A-F).

## 3. Process
1. Data ingestion pipeline aggregating on-chain analytics, financials, and market data.
2. Expert review committee validates assumptions, flags anomalies.
3. Publish scorecards with narrative commentary and risk warnings.
4. Continuous monitoring triggers grade revisions based on thresholds.

## 4. Tooling
- Dashboard with scenario analysis and sensitivity testing.
- API for downstream products (wallet risk badges, exchange listings).
- Automated alerting for rapid degradation (security incidents, governance failures).

## 5. Research Agenda
- Explainable AI for token risk classification.
- Integration with regulatory sandboxes and rating agencies.
- Behavioral finance studies on grade impact to market dynamics.

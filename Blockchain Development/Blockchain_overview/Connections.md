# Network Connections Topology

## 1. Overlay Design
- Hybrid mesh + structured overlays (Kademlia DHT) to balance discovery speed and resilience.
- Region-aware peer selection to minimize latency and correlate failure domains.

## 2. Connection Lifecycle
- Secure handshake (Noise/QUIC) with mutual authentication.
- Peer scoring to penalize spam, low bandwidth, or malicious behavior.
- Connection churn handling with backoff strategies and dialer heuristics.

## 3. Instrumentation
- Collect RTT, bandwidth, failure rates, peer reputation scores.
- Visualize topology dynamics for capacity planning.

## 4. Research Directions
- Adaptive networking that leverages SDN and satellite links.
- Privacy-preserving peer sampling using differential privacy.
- Multipath transport for censorship resistance.

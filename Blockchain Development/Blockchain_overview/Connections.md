# Network Connections

## Inbound vs Outbound
- Maintain mix to avoid eclipse attacks.
- Limit per-IP connections to reduce Sybil exposure.

## Encryption & Authentication
- TLS/Noise handshake with certificate pinning for validators.
- Optional authenticated channels for compliance zones.

## Quality of Service
- Prioritize consensus traffic over bulk data.
- Implement congestion control (QUIC) and adaptive rate limiting.

## Monitoring
- Connection health metrics: RTT, packet loss, throughput.
- Automated remediation: connection resets, peer blacklisting.

# State Channels Strategy

## 1. Concept
State channels move frequent interactions off-chain, settling only netted results on the base layer. Ideal for micro-payments, gaming, and latency-sensitive coordination.

## 2. Lifecycle
1. **Channel opening:** On-chain deposit contract locks collateral and defines dispute rules.
2. **Off-chain updates:** Parties exchange signed state updates with monotonically increasing version numbers.
3. **Dispute resolution:** Any party can submit latest signed state to L1; timers enforce liveness.
4. **Settlement:** Funds redistributed per final state; optional channel reuse via virtual channels or routing networks.

## 3. Design Considerations
- **Routing:** Multi-hop payment routing (Lightning, Raiden) requiring pathfinding algorithms and liquidity management.
- **Security:** Watchtowers to monitor chain for malicious closures; penalty transactions to deter misbehavior.
- **Privacy:** Onion routing and zero-knowledge payment proofs to conceal balances and routes.

## 4. Metrics & Monitoring
- Channel uptime, dispute frequency, routing success rate, liquidity utilization.
- Economic incentives for routing nodes and watchtower operators.

## 5. Research Directions
- Generalized state channels supporting arbitrary smart contract logic.
- Interoperable channel networks bridging different chains.
- Automatic liquidity rebalancing using batch auctions or streaming swaps.

# State Channels

## Overview
- Off-chain interaction model where participants lock funds on-chain and exchange signed state updates.
- Only open and close transactions touch the base layer, enabling instant settlement.

## Lifecycle
1. Channel establishment with multisignature smart contract.
2. Off-chain negotiation of state transitions, co-signed by participants.
3. Dispute resolution via on-chain adjudicator enforcing latest valid state.
4. Channel closure and fund redistribution.

## Variants
- Payment channels (Lightning Network).
- Generalized state channels supporting arbitrary smart contract logic (Counterfactual, Perun).
- Virtual channels enabling multi-hop connectivity without on-chain collateral.

## Design Considerations
- Watchtower services to monitor for fraud attempts.
- Liquidity management and rebalancing strategies.
- Privacy enhancements (PTLCs, adaptor signatures).
- Regulatory compliance for custodial routing nodes.

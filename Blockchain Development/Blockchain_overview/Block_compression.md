# Block Compression Strategies

## Objectives
- Reduce storage footprint without compromising verifiability.
- Improve synchronization times for new nodes and archival systems.

## Techniques
- **Transaction Deduplication**: Remove redundant witness data (SegWit-style separation).
- **Canonical Encoding**: Use protobuf/SSZ with field order standardization and varint encoding.
- **State Delta Compression**: Store differences relative to previous state roots.
- **Zero-Knowledge Succinct Proofs**: Replace raw transaction data with validity proofs for rollup batches.
- **Erasure Coding**: Disperse data across shards with Reed-Solomon or LDPC codes to enhance availability.

## Pipeline
1. Validate block using full data.
2. Generate compressed artifact (e.g., Brotli, Zstandard, bespoke domain compression).
3. Publish commitments to ensure reconstructability.
4. Provide decompression libraries to explorers and analytics platforms.

## Metrics
- Compression ratio (%) per block type.
- CPU overhead vs. storage savings.
- Latency impact on block propagation.

## Roadmap
- Research adaptive compression using machine learning for transaction patterns.
- Evaluate hardware acceleration (FPGA/GPU) for decompression on high-throughput nodes.
- Align with regulatory requirements on data retention and evidentiary standards.

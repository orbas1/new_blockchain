# Block Compression & Storage Optimization

## 1. Motivation
Blockchains generate terabytes of data annually; compression reduces storage burden, sync times, and bandwidth usage while preserving verifiability.

## 2. Compression Layers
- **Transaction-level:** Delta-encoding of account balances, signature aggregation (BLS, Schnorr) to compress witness data.
- **Block-level:** Use of succinct commitment schemes, calldata de-duplication, and content-defined chunking before erasure coding.
- **State snapshots:** Periodic compressed state exports using Verkle tries with polynomial commitments.

## 3. Techniques
| Technique | Description | Impact | Considerations |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zstandard / LZ4 | Fast, lossless compression for gossip payloads | Reduced bandwidth | CPU overhead, needs deterministic configuration |
| Binary canonical encoding | Remove redundant JSON/RLP wrappers | Smaller blocks | Requires consensus on encoding standard |
| Sparse Merkle pruning | Drop stale branches with cryptographic proofs | Lower disk | Maintain witnesses for historical queries |
| zk-SNARK rollups | Offload execution, post succinct proof | Massive compression | Trusted setup, prover resources |

## 4. Implementation Guidance
- Maintain deterministic compression outputs to avoid consensus divergence.
- Version compression codecs to enable safe upgrades and backward compatibility.
- Provide fallbacks for light clients (pre-compressed snapshots, chunk streaming).

## 5. Tooling
- Compression-aware block explorers that display raw vs effective data size.
- Storage simulators projecting growth under varied workloads.
- Benchmarks with synthetic workloads capturing contract-heavy, NFT, and DeFi scenarios.

## 6. Research Agenda
- Hardware-accelerated proof generation (GPUs, FPGAs) for rollup compression.
- Content-addressable storage protocols with verifiable deduplication.
- Probabilistic data structures (Bloom filters, Cuckoo filters) for state availability proofs.

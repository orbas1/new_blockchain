# Block Composition Blueprint

## 1. Structure
- **Header:** Parent hash, state root, transactions root, receipts root, timestamp, proposer identity, consensus metadata.
- **Body:** Ordered transactions, attestations, consensus votes, and optional MEV bundles.
- **Auxiliary data:** Prover transcripts, zk-SNARK proofs, or fraud proof commitments depending on scaling strategy.

## 2. Construction Pipeline
1. Transaction selection with fee prioritization and inclusion lists.
2. Execution simulation to ensure gas limits and state access sets.
3. Header assembly with cryptographic commitments.
4. Broadcast via gossip and propagation optimization (compact block relay).

## 3. Quality Controls
- Deterministic serialization (RLP/SSZ) to avoid consensus splits.
- Block validity rules encoded in formal specs and fuzz-tested.
- Telemetry capturing gas utilization, MEV capture, and execution anomalies.

## 4. Research Agenda
- Proposer-builder separation markets for fair ordering.
- Inclusion proofs for cross-chain bridging and rollups.
- Adaptive block sizes based on network congestion and latency targets.

# Network Architecture

## 1. Layers
- Transport (QUIC), session (Noise), routing (libp2p), application (gossip, RPC).

## 2. Performance Goals
- Latency targets, throughput, resilience to churn.

## 3. Security
- DDoS mitigation, eclipse attack prevention, anomaly detection.

## 4. Monitoring
- Network telemetry, packet capture, intrusion detection.

## 5. Research Agenda
- Satellite and 5G integration.
- Adaptive network slicing for QoS.

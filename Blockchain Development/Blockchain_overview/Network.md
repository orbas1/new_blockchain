# Network Architecture

## Layers
- P2P gossip layer for block and transaction propagation.
- RPC/API layer for external client access.
- Monitoring and telemetry layer for observability.

## Protocols
- LibP2P-based stack with multiplexing (mplex/quic) and encryption (Noise).
- GossipSub for efficient message dissemination.
- Content-addressed retrieval for historical data via Bitswap/IPFS.

## Performance Targets
- Propagation time < 2 seconds for 95% of nodes.
- Bandwidth optimization via compression and differential sync.
- Resilience against DDoS using rate limiting and peer scoring.

## Operations
- Network upgrade procedures with version handshakes.
- Canary networks for testing new protocol versions.
- Incident response playbooks for outages and attacks.

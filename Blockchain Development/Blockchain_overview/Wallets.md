# Wallet Infrastructure (Doctoral Expansion)

## 1. Functional Scope
- Key custody, transaction assembly, signing, broadcasting, and portfolio analytics.
- Integrations with dApps, DeFi protocols, identity credentials, and compliance attestations.

## 2. Architecture
- **Client types:** Web, mobile, hardware, custodial, MPC-based enterprise wallets.
- **Key management:** Hierarchical deterministic wallets (BIP-32), threshold signatures, account abstraction smart contract wallets.
- **Security layers:** Biometric gating, secure enclaves, phishing resistant UX, transaction simulation.

## 3. User Experience Considerations
- Progressive disclosure of risk, transaction previews, and gas estimation.
- Multi-language support, accessibility features, and compliance prompts for KYC flows.
- Social recovery, delegated session keys, and privacy-preserving address books.

## 4. Operational Metrics
- Signing latency, success rate, device coverage, and security incident frequency.
- Telemetry privacy: opt-in analytics, differential privacy for aggregate insights.

## 5. Research Directions
- Account abstraction enabling sponsored transactions and programmable policies.
- Zero-knowledge proofs for balance attestations without revealing holdings.
- Interoperable wallets managing cross-chain identities and credentials.

# Storage Architecture

## Objectives
- Durable retention of blockchain data with efficient retrieval.
- Support archival, full, and light node requirements.

## Components
- Hot storage: SSD arrays for current state and recent blocks.
- Cold storage: Object storage (S3 compatible) for historical data.
- Off-chain backups: Distributed storage networks (IPFS/Filecoin, Arweave).

## Optimization Techniques
- Pruning of spent UTXOs and obsolete states.
- Sparse Merkle Trees enabling stateless clients.
- Tiered storage policies using block age and access frequency.

## Operational Considerations
- Encryption at rest, key management, and rotation.
- Integrity checks via periodic hash verification.
- Disaster recovery runbooks with RPO/RTO targets.

# Native Coin Economics

## 1. Role
- Medium of exchange for fees, staking collateral, governance, and ecosystem incentives.
- Reserve asset for DeFi primitives and cross-chain collateralization.

## 2. Monetary Policy Options
- **Fixed supply:** Predictable scarcity but limited monetary flexibility.
- **Tail emission:** Sustains validator rewards and security budgets.
- **Algorithmic adjustments:** Dynamic inflation tied to security spending or economic throughput.

## 3. Distribution Mechanics
- Genesis allocations (founders, community, investors) with vesting schedules and clawback clauses.
- On-chain auctions for validator slots or parachain leases.
- Continuous emission allocated to validators, developers, and public goods funds.

## 4. Treasury & Governance
- Treasury controlled via quadratic funding, retroactive grants, and milestone-based disbursements.
- Macroprudential levers: staking rate adjustments, fee burn vs redistribution.

## 5. Risk Management
- Liquidity support (market makers, AMMs).
- Collateralization parameters for lending protocols.
- Monitoring price manipulation, oracle reliability, and derivatives exposure.

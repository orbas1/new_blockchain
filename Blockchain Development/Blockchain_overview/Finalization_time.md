# Finalization Time Analysis

## 1. Determinants
- Network latency, validator responsiveness, consensus timeouts.
- Transaction complexity affecting execution and block packing.
- Committee size and signature aggregation overhead.

## 2. Measurement Methodology
- Instrument nodes to record proposal-to-finality timestamps.
- Use synthetic workloads to stress network and identify bottlenecks.
- Publish historical time series for ecosystem stakeholders.

## 3. Optimization Levers
- Adaptive timeout tuning using control theory.
- Prioritized gossip for votes and commitments.
- Pre-confirmations via optimistic sequencing for UX, with risk disclosure.

## 4. Benchmark Targets
- Retail UX: <3 seconds for optimistic confirmation, <15 seconds deterministic.
- Institutional settlement: <60 seconds for high-value transfers.
- Cross-chain operations: Align with bridge SLAs and challenge periods.

## 5. Research Directions
- Probabilistic models for finality under partial synchrony.
- Multi-chain coordination for synchronized finality windows.
- Integration with carbon/energy-aware scheduling.

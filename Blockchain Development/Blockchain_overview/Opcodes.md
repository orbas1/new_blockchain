# Opcode Catalogue

## 1. Categorization
- Arithmetic, logical, cryptographic, storage, control flow, environmental, system, and custom domain-specific opcodes.

## 2. Design Considerations
- Gas cost calibration via benchmarking across reference hardware.
- Deterministic side effects and state access patterns.
- Deprecation policy with upgrade paths and backward compatibility.

## 3. Documentation Requirements
- Formal semantics with operational semantics diagrams.
- Security notes (reentrancy risks, DoS vectors).
- Test vectors and conformance suites.

## 4. Research Directions
- Extending opcode set for zero-knowledge primitives.
- Autogenerated opcode proofs using SMT solvers.
- Domain-specific extensions (e.g., privacy, AI inference).

Hashing Strategies
==================

Purpose
-------
- Provide collision-resistant commitments for blocks, transactions, and state.
- Enable Merkle tree constructions and succinct proofs.

Algorithms
----------
- SHA-2 family for compatibility.
- SHA-3/Keccak for Ethereum-style addresses.
- BLAKE3 for high throughput and SIMD acceleration.
- Poseidon/Rescue for zero-knowledge friendly hashing inside circuits.

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Constant-time implementations to avoid timing leaks.
- Domain separation tags for different object types.
- Support for hash-to-curve operations (BLS signatures, VRFs).

Roadmap
-------
- Evaluate post-quantum hash functions.
- Hardware acceleration via Intel SHA extensions and ARM Cryptography Extensions.

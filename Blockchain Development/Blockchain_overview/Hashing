# Hashing Strategy (Expanded)

## 1. Objectives
Provide collision-resistant commitments for blocks, transactions, state, and off-chain data feeds while enabling verifiable data structures.

## 2. Algorithm Portfolio
- **SHA-2/3:** Compatibility with existing ecosystems and hardware acceleration.
- **BLAKE3:** High throughput, SIMD-friendly for bandwidth-heavy workloads.
- **Poseidon/Rescue:** SNARK-friendly hashes for zero-knowledge circuits.
- **KangarooTwelve:** Lightweight sponge construction for embedded devices.

## 3. Engineering Practices
- Domain separation tags for block headers, transactions, receipts, and consensus messages.
- Constant-time implementations vetted via side-channel audits.
- Hash-to-curve support for BLS signatures and VRFs.
- Periodic algorithm agility reviews for post-quantum preparedness.

## 4. Tooling & Monitoring
- Hash collision monitoring, differential testing across clients, fuzzers for serialization.
- Telemetry on hash computation latency to inform hardware investments.

## 5. Research Agenda
- Verifiable delay hash functions for randomness beacons.
- Multi-party computation for distributed hashing in rollup circuits.
- Quantum-resistant hash selection strategies.

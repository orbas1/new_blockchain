# Command-Line Interface Strategy

## 1. Objectives
Deliver a reproducible, scriptable interface for node operators, developers, and auditors with role-based access and automation hooks.

## 2. Functional Areas
- **Node lifecycle:** init, join, upgrade, snapshot management.
- **Key management:** generation, import/export, MPC coordination.
- **Diagnostics:** log streaming, metrics export, network topology inspection.
- **Governance:** proposal submission, voting, parameter queries.

## 3. Architecture
- Built with Rust/Go for portability; leverages plugin architecture and declarative command schemas.
- Configurable output formats (JSON, YAML, table) for integration with CI/CD and observability stacks.
- Secure credential storage with OS keychains or HSM connectors.

## 4. Usability Enhancements
- Autocomplete, contextual help, and command templates.
- Dry-run mode to simulate transactions.
- Script generators for complex workflows (staking, upgrades).

## 5. Compliance & Security
- Role-based access control, audit logging, and tamper-proof command history.
- Signed releases with reproducible builds, checksum verification.

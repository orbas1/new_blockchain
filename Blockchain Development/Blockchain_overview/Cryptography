Cryptography Stack
==================

Key Areas
---------
- Public-key signatures (ECDSA, EdDSA, BLS) for transaction authentication and consensus votes.
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy and scalability (Groth16, PLONK, STARKs).
- Threshold cryptography for distributed key generation and signing (DKG, TSS).
- Secure randomness via verifiable random functions and distributed randomness beacons.

Security Practices
------------------
- Formal verification of cryptographic libraries.
- Audit trails for key ceremonies and trusted setups.
- Upgradability plan for post-quantum primitives (Dilithium, Falcon, Picnic).

Compliance Considerations
-------------------------
- Export control adherence for cryptographic algorithms.
- Documentation for regulators regarding encryption usage and key recovery policies.

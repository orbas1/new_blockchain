# Cryptographic Foundations

## 1. Primitives
- Digital signatures (Ed25519, BLS12-381, post-quantum candidates).
- Hash functions (SHA-3, BLAKE3, Poseidon).
- Key agreement (X25519, ECDH over secp256k1).
- Zero-knowledge proofs (SNARKs, STARKs, Bulletproofs).

## 2. System Integration
- Signature aggregation for consensus scalability.
- Threshold cryptography for MPC custody and DAO key management.
- Commitment schemes for confidentiality (Pedersen, ElGamal).

## 3. Security Engineering
- Formal verification of cryptographic implementations (Fiat-Crypto, HACL*).
- Constant-time, side-channel resistant coding standards.
- Hardware root of trust (TEE attestation, TPM integration).

## 4. Research Frontier
- Post-quantum transition roadmap (lattice-based signatures, hash-based accumulators).
- Succinct proofs for machine learning models embedded in smart contracts.
- Cryptographic accountability via privacy-preserving audit trails.

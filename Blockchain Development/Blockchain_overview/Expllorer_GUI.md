# Explorer GUI Requirements (Doctoral Expansion)

## 1. Vision
Provide a forensic-grade analytics console enabling stakeholders to audit consensus health, economic activity, and smart contract behavior with sub-second responsiveness.

## 2. Core Modules
- **Block timeline:** Real-time visualization with finality annotations, fork indicators, and MEV events.
- **Transaction inspector:** Decode calldata, trace execution, display gas attribution and event logs.
- **Validator dashboard:** Performance metrics, slashing history, geographical dispersion.
- **Economics panel:** Supply charts, inflation rates, fee burn, staking ratios.

## 3. UX Principles
- Role-based customization for regulators, developers, and retail users.
- Exportable datasets (CSV, parquet) with API integration for programmatic access.
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1), localization, and responsive design.

## 4. Advanced Features
- On-chain governance visualizations (proposal lifecycle, vote distribution).
- Alerting system hooking into webhooks, Slack, or PagerDuty.
- Integration with zero-knowledge proof verifiers for privacy-preserving analytics.

## 5. Implementation Notes
- Backend indexing via scalable data warehouses (ClickHouse, BigQuery).
- Caching strategies (GraphQL federation, CDN) for global performance.
- Security hardening: CSP headers, content sanitization, and audit logging.

# Fee Dispersion & Distribution (Expanded)

## 1. Fee Sources
- Base transaction fees, priority tips, blob fees (data availability), MEV auctions, bridge tolls.

## 2. Allocation Policy
- Multi-bucket allocation: validator rewards, sequencer rebates, treasury endowment, insurance fund, burn module.
- Dynamic weighting via governance or automated controllers reacting to security budget metrics.

## 3. Distribution Pipeline
1. **Collection:** Fees aggregated per block with provenance metadata.
2. **Accounting:** Smart contract ledger splits revenue per policy; handles rounding errors via buffer accounts.
3. **Settlement:** Epoch payouts with slashing-aware adjustments and public dashboards.
4. **Audit:** Periodic reconciliation against off-chain accounting systems.

## 4. Transparency & Reporting
- Open data feeds, Merkle proofs of distribution, third-party attestations.
- User-facing dashboards highlighting fee burn vs redistribution trends.

## 5. Research Agenda
- Mechanisms for user fee rebates and loyalty incentives.
- Cross-layer fee sharing between L1 and rollups.
- Game-theoretic analysis of MEV revenue sharing schemes.

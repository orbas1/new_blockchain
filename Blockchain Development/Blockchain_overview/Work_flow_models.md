- **Trigger**: Application approval.

- **Artifacts**: Checklists, monitoring dashboards, compliance attestations.

## Software Release Model
- Ideation → RFC → implementation → code review → testnet deployment → mainnet release.
- Gateways: security audit sign-off, governance vote, rollback plan ready.

## Incident Response Model
- Detection → triage → containment → remediation → post-mortem.
- RACI matrix defining roles (incident commander, communications lead, technical lead).

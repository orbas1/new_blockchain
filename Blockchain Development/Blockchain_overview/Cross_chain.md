# Cross-Chain Interoperability

## Goals
- Facilitate asset transfers, messaging, and shared security across heterogeneous chains.

## Approaches
- **Light Client Bridges**: Verify counterpart chain headers (IBC, Rainbow bridge).
- **Liquidity Networks**: Use bonded market makers for instant swaps.
- **Relayer Networks**: Decentralized relayers submit proofs with slashing-backed security.
- **Shared Sequencers**: Coordinate rollups for atomic composability.

## Security Considerations
- Multi-signature vs. threshold cryptography for bridge control.
- Replay protection, message nonce management.
- Monitoring for chain reorgs and pausing mechanisms.

## Roadmap
- Standardize cross-chain messaging formats (XCM, GMP).
- Develop interoperability testing suite for integration partners.
- Explore cross-chain MEV mitigation and fair ordering protocols.

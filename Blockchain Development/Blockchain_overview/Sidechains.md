# Sidechains & Interoperable Parachains

## 1. Purpose
Sidechains provide specialized execution environments tethered to a root chain via trust-minimized bridges. They enable scalability, jurisdictional compliance, and domain-specific optimizations without overloading the base layer.

## 2. Security Models
- **Federated bridges:** Multi-signature custodians, suitable for consortium deployments but with explicit trust assumptions.
- **Light-client bridges:** Verify consensus proofs (SPV, BEEFY) to minimize trust.
- **Optimistic bridges:** Rely on fraud proofs and challenge periods.
- **ZK bridges:** Succinctly prove consensus transitions via SNARK/STARK technology.

## 3. Architecture Stack
1. **Consensus layer:** Could mirror L1 or adopt tuned mechanisms (e.g., fast BFT).
2. **Execution environment:** Tailored VM (EVM, WASM, UTXO) with domain-specific precompiles.
3. **Communication:** Channels for cross-chain messaging, asset transfers, and shared security signals.
4. **Governance:** Delegated authorities to adjust fees, validator sets, and compliance parameters.

## 4. Risk Controls
- Continuous monitoring of bridge collateral, validator performance, and message delays.
- Mandatory withdrawal caps and circuit breakers.
- Incident drills covering bridge key compromise, message replay, and partial chain halts.

## 5. Research Agenda
- Shared security frameworks (Polkadot parachains, Cosmos Interchain Security).
- Zero-knowledge light clients for resource-constrained devices.
- Legal interoperability agreements for cross-jurisdiction operation.

# Technical Architecture

The platform is realized through a layered reference stack that integrates consensus, networking, execution, and data services into a resilient, upgradeable fabric. Each layer adheres to interface contracts that enable independent evolution, fault isolation, and compliance-driven auditability.

## Layered Stack
1. **Foundation Layer**
   - **Hardware assumptions**: commodity servers with hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure enclaves for key custody.
   - **Operating environment**: containerized deployments orchestrated via Kubernetes or validator-managed bare metal.
   - **Time synchronization**: PTP-enabled clocks with fallback NTP quorum for deterministic block timestamps.
2. **Networking Layer**
   - **Transport**: QUIC-based peer-to-peer networking with adaptive congestion control and DoS mitigation via bandwidth tokens.
   - **Peer discovery**: Kademlia-based DHT with stake-weighted peer scoring and geographic diversity constraints.
   - **Gossip protocols**: topic-specific pub/sub channels separating consensus votes, block propagation, and telemetry.
3. **Consensus Layer**
   - **Hybrid BFT**: leader-rotating HotStuff variant fused with verifiable delay function (VDF) leader election for liveness under partial synchrony.
   - **Finality gadgets**: multi-round voting with aggregated BLS signatures, providing <6 second finality.
   - **Slashing and recovery**: deterministic punishment rules for double-signing, equivocation, and availability violations, coupled with state sync to rehydrate honest nodes.
4. **Execution Layer**
   - **Virtual machines**: WASM runtime with eBPF acceleration and EVM compatibility via translation layer.
   - **State management**: Merkle-Patricia trie with sparse Merkle proofs optimized via Poseidon hashing for zero-knowledge compatibility.
   - **Resource metering**: multi-dimensional fee market (compute, storage, bandwidth) with congestion-sensitive pricing.
5. **Data Layer**
   - **Storage**: erasure-coded archival storage, pruning horizons, and availability sampling for light clients.
   - **Compression**: zk-SNARK anchored rollup commitments and recursive proofs for global state snapshots.
   - **Indexing**: SQL/OLAP hybrids with streaming pipelines feeding analytics dashboards and regulatory reporting.
6. **Interface Layer**
   - **APIs**: GraphQL, gRPC, and REST endpoints with role-based access control and rate limiting.
   - **SDKs**: language-specific bindings (Rust, TypeScript, Python) for smart-contract deployment and data ingestion.
   - **Tooling**: CLI, GUI dashboards, and integrations with observability suites (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry).

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Security**: multi-signature governance for protocol upgrades, hardware root of trust, and layered intrusion detection.
- **Compliance**: policy engines enforcing KYC/AML rules via attestations, with selective disclosure mechanisms using zero-knowledge proofs.
- **Observability**: structured logging, distributed tracing, and real-time metrics exported to SOC dashboards.
- **Upgradeability**: on-chain feature flags, semantic version negotiation, and deterministic replay testing before activation.

## Deployment Topologies
- **Public mainnet**: globally distributed validators with permissionless participation and economic incentives.
- **Consortium subnet**: permissioned validator set for regulated industries, inheriting security from the main chain via shared finality checkpoints.
- **Application rollups**: specialized execution environments with dedicated resource quotas and interoperable bridges.

The technical architecture harmonizes rigorous engineering disciplines with governance-aware flexibility, allowing the network to evolve without sacrificing reliability or security guarantees.

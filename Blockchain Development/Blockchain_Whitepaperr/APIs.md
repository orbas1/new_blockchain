# APIs

The API layer offers programmatic access to blockchain services, enabling integration with external systems, dApps, and analytics platforms.

## API Taxonomy
- **Public APIs**: REST and GraphQL endpoints providing read access to blocks, transactions, accounts, and smart-contract events.
- **Authenticated APIs**: gRPC services for validator operations, staking management, and governance submissions.
- **Regulated APIs**: permissioned data feeds delivering compliance-relevant information under jurisdictional controls.

## Design Principles
- **Consistency**: standardized schemas across endpoints with versioned contracts.
- **Security**: OAuth2.1, mutual TLS, and rate limiting; signed payloads for state-changing requests.
- **Observability**: structured logging and request tracing for auditability and performance optimization.

## Core Endpoints
1. **Ledger Service**: account balances, transaction history, Merkle proofs.
2. **Consensus Service**: validator set details, epoch summaries, finality checkpoints.
3. **Execution Service**: smart contract invocation, gas estimation, simulation results.
4. **Analytics Service**: KPI feeds, anomaly alerts, sustainability metrics.
5. **Governance Service**: proposals, votes, delegate registry, policy documents.

## SDK Ecosystem
- **TypeScript SDK**: front-end integration with wallet adapters and dApp scaffolding.
- **Rust SDK**: validator tooling, custom rollup development, and performance-critical applications.
- **Python SDK**: data science workflows, compliance automation, and machine learning integrations.

## Compliance & Data Governance
- **Access Controls**: role-based API keys with granular scopes and expiration policies.
- **Data Residency**: geo-fenced endpoints for regulated entities requiring localization.
- **Audit Support**: immutable logs and verifiable credentials for third-party auditors.

The API suite empowers developers and institutions to interact with the blockchain reliably while adhering to stringent security and compliance standards.

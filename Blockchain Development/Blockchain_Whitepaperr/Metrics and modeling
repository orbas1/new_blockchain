# Metrics and Modeling

This section enumerates the quantitative indicators and modeling methodologies that guide operational decisions and strategic planning.

## Metrics Framework
- **Core Metrics**
  - Consensus: block time, finality variance, validator participation rate.
  - Network: average propagation delay, packet loss, peer churn index.
  - Execution: gas usage per contract class, storage growth, opcode distribution.
  - Economics: staking ratio, fee revenue per block, token velocity, treasury solvency ratio.
- **Secondary Metrics**
  - User experience: transaction success rate, wallet latency, support ticket volume.
  - Security: detected anomalies, slashing incidents, MEV capture share.
  - Sustainability: energy intensity per transaction, geographic node distribution.

## Modeling Techniques
- **Time-Series Forecasting**: ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models predict gas prices, transaction volume, and stake participation.
- **Causal Inference**: difference-in-differences and synthetic control models evaluate impact of protocol upgrades.
- **Optimization Models**: linear programming aligns treasury allocations with strategic objectives and risk constraints.
- **Simulation**: agent-based models stress-test governance turnout, market liquidity, and validator coordination.

## Data Sources
- **On-chain Telemetry**: consensus events, transaction logs, state diffs.
- **Off-chain Integrations**: exchange price feeds, regulatory databases, sustainability sensors.
- **Survey Instruments**: stakeholder sentiment surveys inform qualitative weighting in multi-criteria decision analyses.

## Governance Integration
- **Metric Thresholds**: governance charters define SLA thresholds triggering policy reviews.
- **Transparency Portals**: dashboards expose metrics to community members for accountability.
- **Feedback Loops**: metric deviations feed into improvement proposals with root cause analyses.

A disciplined metrics and modeling program ensures the blockchain's evolution remains evidence-based, aligning technical performance with economic resilience and community expectations.

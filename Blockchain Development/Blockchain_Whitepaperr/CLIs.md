# CLIs

Command-line interfaces support power users, validators, and developers with scriptable access to blockchain functionality.

## CLI Suite
1. **Node CLI**
   - Node provisioning, configuration management, state sync, and diagnostics.
   - Secure key handling with hardware wallet integration and threshold signing support.
2. **Validator CLI**
   - Staking operations, reward withdrawal, performance benchmarking, and governance voting automation.
   - Slashing appeal workflows and compliance reporting exports.
3. **Developer CLI**
   - Smart contract compilation, deployment, debugging, and local testnet orchestration.
   - Integration with linting, formal verification, and continuous integration pipelines.
4. **Operations CLI**
   - Network monitoring, topology visualization, incident response playbooks, and log collection.
   - Supports multi-tenancy with RBAC profiles and audit logs.

## Design Considerations
- **Usability**: human-friendly commands with auto-complete, inline help, and guided wizards for complex tasks.
- **Security**: secure credential storage, command signing, and tamper-evident logs.
- **Extensibility**: plugin architecture enabling community modules and custom workflows.

## Automation & Scripting
- **Infrastructure-as-Code**: CLI commands expose declarative configuration for GitOps pipelines.
- **Task Scheduling**: cron-compatible wrappers automate routine maintenance and reporting tasks.
- **Event Hooks**: webhooks and message bus integrations trigger off-chain automation based on on-chain events.

The CLI ecosystem empowers technical stakeholders to operate the blockchain efficiently, integrating with DevSecOps practices and enterprise compliance requirements.

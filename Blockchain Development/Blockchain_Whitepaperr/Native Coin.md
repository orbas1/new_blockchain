# Native Coin

The native coin underpins economic security, resource pricing, and governance participation. Its issuance, distribution, and utility are calibrated to sustain validator incentives while encouraging productive on-chain activity.

## Monetary Policy
- **Initial Supply**: 1 billion units minted at genesis, with 40% allocated to staking rewards, 20% to ecosystem grants, 20% to treasury reserves, 10% to strategic partners, and 10% to public sale participants.
- **Inflation Schedule**: exponential decay model starting at 6% annualized inflation, halving every four years until stabilizing at 1% tail emission to preserve security budget.
- **Deflationary Levers**: protocol-level fee burns, inactivity slashing, and optional lockdrop programs tied to governance proposals.

## Utility Functions
1. **Staking Collateral**: validators bond coins to participate in consensus, subject to slashing for misbehavior.
2. **Fee Payment**: transactions, smart-contract execution, and data storage are priced in native coin with dynamic base fee.
3. **Governance Voting**: voting power is derived from stake-weighted locks with quadratic modifiers for community pools.
4. **Liquidity Backstop**: treasury-managed market operations stabilize volatility via algorithmic market operations and reserve baskets.

## Distribution Mechanisms
- **Proof-of-Stake Rewards**: block proposers and attesters receive base rewards scaled by performance metrics.
- **Ecosystem Incentives**: grants, hackathon rewards, and liquidity mining programs allocated by governance.
- **Community Pools**: delegators can opt into pooled staking services, receiving proportional rewards minus service fees.

## Risk Mitigation
- **Slashing Insurance**: mutualized insurance fund reimburses delegators affected by validator slashing.
- **Volatility Controls**: adaptive treasury policies rebalance between stablecoins, fiat reserves, and diversified assets.
- **Compliance Guardrails**: optional whitelisting for regulated entities with transparent reporting to authorities.

The native coin is engineered to balance security guarantees with usability, enabling long-term network sustainability and equitable participation.

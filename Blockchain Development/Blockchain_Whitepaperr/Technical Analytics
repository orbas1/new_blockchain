# Technical Analytics

The analytics framework supplies real-time visibility into protocol health, enabling data-driven governance and operational agility.

## Observability Stack
- **Data Collection**: OpenTelemetry agents capture metrics, traces, and logs from validators, full nodes, and infrastructure.
- **Ingestion Pipeline**: Kafka streams aggregate telemetry, feeding time-series databases (Prometheus, TimescaleDB) and data lakes.
- **Visualization**: Grafana dashboards with customizable panels for latency, finality, mempool depth, and validator performance.

## Key Performance Indicators
1. **Consensus Metrics**: round duration, vote participation, fork rate, and finality lag.
2. **Network Metrics**: propagation delay, peer churn rate, bandwidth utilization, and error rates.
3. **Execution Metrics**: gas utilization, contract failure ratio, state growth rate, and opcode frequency.
4. **Economic Metrics**: staking participation, fee burn rate, liquidity in staking derivatives, and validator ROI.

## Advanced Analytics
- **Predictive Maintenance**: machine learning models forecast node failures based on telemetry anomalies.
- **MEV Monitoring**: block-level analysis detects maximal extractable value activities and quantifies redistribution policies.
- **Fraud Detection**: graph analytics identify wash trading, mixer usage, and regulatory red flags.

## Reporting Cadence
- **Real-time Alerts**: thresholds trigger PagerDuty/Slack notifications for SRE and security teams.
- **Daily Briefings**: automated summaries highlight key metrics, anomalies, and pending governance actions.
- **Quarterly Reviews**: comprehensive reports benchmark KPIs against targets, feeding strategic planning.

## Data Governance & Access
- **Role-Based Access Control**: multi-tier access to dashboards and raw data to protect sensitive information.
- **Data Retention Policies**: hot storage (30 days), warm storage (1 year), and cold archival for compliance auditing.
- **Privacy Safeguards**: pseudonymized datasets with differential privacy noise for publicly shared analytics.

The technical analytics program ensures stakeholders possess empirical evidence to guide operational decisions, detect anomalies, and validate progress toward performance objectives.

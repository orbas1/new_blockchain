# Network Model

The network model orchestrates peer connectivity, message propagation, and topology governance to ensure low-latency communication and resilience against adversarial behavior.

## Topology Design
- **Hybrid Mesh**: combines structured overlay (Kademlia DHT) for discovery with adaptive mesh for data propagation.
- **Regional Hubs**: strategically positioned relay nodes reduce cross-continental latency while maintaining decentralization.
- **Bandwidth Allocation**: stake-weighted bandwidth tokens allocate propagation priority; validators must provision minimum bandwidth quotas.

## Peer Lifecycle
1. **Discovery**: nodes register in peer directory with attested metadata (latency, jurisdiction, compliance tags).
2. **Handshake**: mutual authentication via TLS 1.3 with post-quantum key exchange (Kyber) and noise-based session rotation.
3. **Reputation Scoring**: metrics include uptime, responsiveness, and message integrity; poor performers throttled or quarantined.
4. **Churn Management**: gossip-based heartbeat and snapshot syncing minimize impact of churn.

## Message Propagation
- **Gossip Channels**: segregated channels for blocks, votes, transactions, telemetry; ensures QoS per message type.
- **Erasure Coding**: large blocks segmented using Reed-Solomon coding to improve resilience against packet loss.
- **Compression**: delta encoding and Snappy compression reduce payload size for high-frequency messages.

## Security & Compliance
- **Sybil Resistance**: stake bonding and proof-of-identity attestations limit malicious node proliferation.
- **DoS Mitigation**: rate limits, peer scoring, and proof-of-work challenges for untrusted inbound connections.
- **Regulatory Controls**: network supports jurisdiction-based routing preferences and lawful intercept under governance oversight.

## Observability
- **Metrics**: latency histograms, bandwidth consumption, gossip efficiency, and peer churn tracked via Prometheus exporters.
- **Alerts**: dynamic thresholds for propagation lag and partition detection; automated incident escalation.
- **Visualization**: topology graphs and heatmaps accessible via network operations center (NOC) dashboards.

The network model ensures deterministic data availability, predictable latency, and governance-aligned operations, forming the communication backbone of the blockchain.

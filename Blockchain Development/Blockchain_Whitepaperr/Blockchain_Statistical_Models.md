# Blockchain Statistical Models

This chapter codifies the quantitative frameworks applied to measure network performance, reliability, and participant behavior.

## Throughput & Latency Modeling
- **Queueing Theory**: M/M/1 and M/G/1 models simulate transaction queues under varying arrival rates and service times.
- **Latency Distributions**: empirical latency fitted to log-normal curves for probabilistic SLA guarantees.
- **Capacity Planning**: Little's Law integrated with consensus-specific parameters to forecast saturation thresholds.

## Reliability Analysis
- **Availability Modeling**: Markov chains represent node up/down states; network availability target set at 99.95%.
- **Fault Tolerance**: probabilistic risk assessment calculates likelihood of correlated validator failures.
- **Disaster Recovery**: time-to-recover metrics modeled via stochastic Petri nets capturing failover workflows.

## Security Analytics
- **Attack Surface Quantification**: Bayesian networks model probability of double-spend, long-range, and censorship attacks.
- **Slashing Event Analysis**: survival analysis on validator cohorts to predict default rates and necessary insurance reserves.
- **Anomaly Detection**: unsupervised machine learning (autoencoders, isolation forests) applied to transaction graph metrics.

## Economic Behavior
- **Staking Participation**: discrete choice models estimate validator entry/exit probability based on yields and operating costs.
- **Fee Market Dynamics**: econometric time-series (ARIMA, GARCH) analyze gas price volatility.
- **User Adoption**: diffusion of innovation curves predict user onboarding across market segments.

## Data Governance
- **Sampling Strategy**: stratified sampling ensures analytics dashboards capture representative transaction profiles.
- **Data Quality Metrics**: completeness, accuracy, timeliness, and consistency tracked with automated checksums.
- **Privacy Preservation**: differential privacy noise calibration balances analytical utility and confidentiality.

These statistical models enable proactive monitoring, risk mitigation, and capacity planning, keeping the network robust under evolving workloads and adversarial pressures.

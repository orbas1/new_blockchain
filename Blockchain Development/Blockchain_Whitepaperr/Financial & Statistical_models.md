# Financial & Statistical Models

This section synthesizes macroeconomic planning with quantitative risk analytics to ensure sustainable token economics and fiscal accountability.

## Treasury Modeling
- **Revenue Streams**: transaction fees, MEV auctions, bridge tolls, and staking derivative royalties.
- **Expense Forecasting**: validator rewards, grants, bug bounties, legal compliance, and infrastructure subsidies.
- **Scenario Analysis**: Monte Carlo simulations stress-test treasury runway across adoption, volatility, and regulatory scenarios.

## Token Velocity & Demand
- **Velocity Equation**: V = PQ / M adapted for token supply, transaction volume (P), and economic output (Q).
- **Demand Drivers**: staking yield, collateral requirements for DeFi, governance participation incentives, and cross-chain utility.
- **Elasticity Modeling**: econometric regression quantifies how fee levels and staking yields influence demand elasticity.

## Risk Metrics
- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: parametric and historical VaR applied to treasury holdings and staking derivatives.
- **Stress Testing**: scenario matrices for validator churn, network downtime, and sudden regulatory bans.
- **Liquidity Ratios**: quick ratio, current ratio, and staking coverage ratio benchmarked against policy thresholds.

## Incentive Alignment
- **Reward Curve Optimization**: game-theoretic modeling balances validator ROI against decentralization metrics.
- **Delegator Behavior**: agent-based simulations evaluate stake migration under varying commission rates.
- **Governance Participation**: logistic regression predicts voter turnout given reward multipliers and proposal impact scores.

## Reporting & Transparency
- **Quarterly Statements**: standardized financial reports with IFRS-inspired disclosures.
- **On-chain Dashboards**: real-time metrics for treasury balances, staking participation, and grant allocations.
- **Audit Trails**: cryptographic proofs ensuring every expenditure references governance authorization.

The financial and statistical models provide a robust quantitative foundation for decision-making, ensuring the network remains solvent, competitive, and equitable across market cycles.

# Daily Use Guide (Doctoral Edition)

## 1. Objective
Provide operational playbooks for end-users, validators, and ecosystem partners to interact with the blockchain on a daily basis while maintaining security hygiene, regulatory compliance, and usability.

## 2. User Personas
| Persona | Goals | Key Interfaces | Risk Profile |
|---|---|---|---|
| Retail User | Send/receive tokens, interact with dApps | Mobile wallet, browser extension, custodial gateway | Phishing, key loss |
| Power User | Yield farming, governance, automation | CLI, multisig wallet, DeFi dashboards | Smart contract risk, liquidation |
| Validator | Maintain node uptime, validate blocks | Validator client, telemetry dashboards | Slashing, operational downtime |
| Enterprise | Treasury operations, compliance | Custodial cold storage, ERP integration | Regulatory, audit, insider threats |

## 3. Daily Routines
1. **Security Check-in:** Review wallet integrity, hardware security module (HSM) health, and MFA status. Rotate session keys.
2. **Network Health Review:** Monitor validator dashboards for latency, missed blocks, and consensus participation. Verify network status alerts.
3. **Transaction Management:** Batch transactions, estimate fees via mempool analytics, and monitor confirmations/finality depth.
4. **Governance Participation:** Evaluate proposals, review impact analyses, cast votes or delegate rights.
5. **Compliance Tasks:** Export transaction logs, update accounting records, reconcile treasury balances with fiat reporting.

## 4. Best Practices
- **Key Management:** Use hardware wallets, secure enclaves, or MPC wallets. Maintain encrypted backups with Shamir secret sharing.
- **Phishing Defense:** Validate domains via ENS/Decentralized identifiers, enable phishing warning lists, and use transaction simulation plugins.
- **Privacy Hygiene:** Rotate addresses, leverage shielded transactions or mixers where legal, and redact metadata in public communications.
- **Automation:** Use bots/scripts for claim distributions, but enforce rate limits, alerting, and manual overrides.

## 5. Tooling Stack
- **Wallets:** Non-custodial (Ledger, Trezor, Keystone), MPC-based custodial platforms, air-gapped signing flows.
- **Analytics:** Dune dashboards, on-chain explorers, mempool analyzers, tax software integrations.
- **Alerting:** Webhooks, push notifications, SMS for critical events (slashing, governance deadlines).
- **Compliance:** Chainalysis KYT, TRISA travel rule gateways, automated SAR filing workflows.

## 6. Incident Response for Users
1. **Compromised Key:** Revoke approvals, move funds to secure accounts, notify governance and compliance teams.
2. **Failed Transaction:** Diagnose via mempool trace, adjust fee, consider replacement transactions (RBF) or cancellation strategies.
3. **Slashing Event:** Investigate root cause, restore node operations, file appeal if due to network fault.
4. **dApp Exploit:** Withdraw funds, communicate with project maintainers, monitor emergency governance proposals.

## 7. Education and Community Engagement
- Conduct weekly office hours, technical AMAs, and security workshops.
- Maintain knowledge bases, runbooks, and multilingual documentation portals.
- Incentivize contributions via bounty programs and ambassador networks.

## 8. Accessibility Considerations
- Provide localized interfaces, screen reader support, and low-bandwidth modes.
- Offer compliance-compatible custodial services for unbanked or mobile-first users.
- Build inclusive governance via quadratic funding, community grants, and multilingual moderation.

## 9. Metrics and Feedback Loops
- Track daily active addresses, transaction success rates, governance participation, and support tickets.
- Run user surveys, usability testing, and cohort analyses to guide roadmap prioritization.

## 10. Future Enhancements
- Integrate adaptive fee suggestions using machine learning, proactive security scoring, and context-aware guidance.
- Explore embedded wallets, account abstraction, and social recovery for mainstream adoption.

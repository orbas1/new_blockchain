# Blockchain Overview (Doctoral Edition)

## 1. Mission Statement
Provide a holistic, systems-level blueprint for the blockchain network covering architecture layers, security posture, economics, governance, and ecosystem integration.

## 2. Layered Architecture Summary
| Layer | Core Functions | Key Stakeholders | Performance Targets |
|---|---|---|---|
| Physical & Network | Connectivity, bandwidth, redundancy | Infrastructure teams, ISPs | <200 ms propagation, 99.99% availability |
| Consensus | Agreement on state transitions | Validators, governance | <2s finality, <1% fork rate |
| Execution | Smart contracts, VM operations | Developers, auditors | Deterministic execution, gas metering |
| Data Availability | Block storage, state synchronization | Full nodes, light clients | 100% availability, merkle proofs |
| Application & UX | dApps, APIs, wallets | Users, integrators | High usability, compliance |

## 3. Governance Framework
- **Bodies:** Protocol council, validator committee, community DAO, advisory board.
- **Processes:** RFC lifecycle (draft, review, vote), emergency upgrades, conflict resolution.
- **Transparency:** Public proposal archive, voting records, treasury disclosures.

## 4. Security Posture
- Defense-in-depth spanning network security, consensus slashing, smart contract audits, and user education.
- Incident response matrix mapping severity levels to actions, communication channels, and forensic procedures.
- Continuous monitoring with anomaly detection, bug bounty programs, and red team exercises.

## 5. Economic Model
- Native token supply policy, reward schedules, fee markets, and burn mechanisms.
- Treasury management with diversification strategies, hedging policies, and grant allocations.
- Economic stress testing for black swan events (liquidity shocks, validator exodus).

## 6. Ecosystem Stack
- Developer tooling: SDKs, APIs, testing frameworks, CI pipelines.
- Partner integrations: exchanges, custodians, oracles, bridges.
- Community programs: grants, hackathons, educational initiatives.

## 7. Compliance & Legal
- Regulatory mapping across jurisdictions, including AML/KYC obligations, securities analysis, and data privacy.
- Legal entities for treasury custody, intellectual property, and ecosystem governance.
- Audit programs for financial reporting and protocol security.

## 8. Sustainability & ESG
- Environmental accounting (energy mix, carbon offsets), social impact programs, governance diversity metrics.
- Incentives for renewable-powered validators and community development funds.

## 9. Roadmap Snapshot
- **Phase 1:** Mainnet stabilization, validator onboarding, core dApp launch.
- **Phase 2:** Scaling solutions (rollups, sharding), cross-chain connectivity, DAO expansion.
- **Phase 3:** Enterprise adoption, real-world asset integration, advanced privacy features.

## 10. KPIs and Reporting
- Network KPIs: TPS, finality time, validator uptime, slashing incidents.
- Economic KPIs: TVL, treasury balance, reward yield, token velocity.
- Community KPIs: governance participation, developer activity, user retention.

## 11. Reference Documentation
- Linkages to consensus, token, network, and smart contract guides for deep dives.
- Catalog of standards (EIPs, BIPs), academic references, and compliance manuals.

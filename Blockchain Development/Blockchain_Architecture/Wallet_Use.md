# Wallet Use Guide (Doctoral Edition)

## 1. Purpose
Outline secure and user-centric wallet operations across custodial and non-custodial environments, covering key management, transaction workflows, compliance, and accessibility.

## 2. Wallet Ecosystem
| Wallet Type | Characteristics | Ideal Users | Security Considerations |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hardware Wallet | Air-gapped signing, physical buttons | Retail, prosumers | Supply chain trust, firmware integrity |
| Mobile Wallet | On-device secure enclave, biometrics | Mass market | Device compromise, backup procedures |
| Desktop Wallet | Rich UI, plugin support | Power users, developers | Malware, keystroke logging |
| MPC Wallet | Distributed signing across parties | Institutions | Threshold configuration, custody agreements |
| Custodial Platform | Managed keys, compliance features | Enterprises | Counterparty risk, regulatory audits |

## 3. Key Management Strategies
- **Seed Generation:** Use verifiable randomness (BIP39/BIP32), entropy audits, and hardware RNG validation.
- **Backup & Recovery:** Shamir Secret Sharing, social recovery (guardians), encrypted off-site storage.
- **Key Rotation:** Scheduled rotation for hot wallets, event-driven rotation after exposure, support for hierarchical deterministic wallets.
- **Multi-Key Schemes:** 2-of-3 multisig, threshold signatures, and programmable policies (time-locks, spending limits).

## 4. Transaction Workflow
1. Compose transaction with explicit metadata and simulation preview.
2. Sign using appropriate account (hardware, MPC) with on-device confirmation.
3. Broadcast through trusted RPC endpoints with fallback relays.
4. Monitor mempool inclusion, finality depth, and produce audit logs.
5. Reconcile with accounting systems and update compliance reports.

## 5. Security Practices
- Enforce device hygiene: OS updates, antivirus, sandboxing, and hardware attestation.
- Use address book whitelists, domain allowlists (EIP-4361 SIWE), and phishing detectors.
- Implement transaction risk scoring and velocity limits.
- Leverage biometric authentication combined with secure enclaves for mobile wallets.

## 6. Compliance Integration
- KYC onboarding with decentralized identity (DID) wallets.
- Travel rule compliance via encrypted payload exchanges and on-chain attestations.
- Tax reporting: generate cost basis, realized gains, and jurisdiction-specific filings.
- Audit readiness: maintain tamper-evident logs and provide view-only access to regulators.

## 7. Accessibility and UX
- Support localization, accessibility features (screen readers), and offline signing workflows.
- Provide contextual education, transaction classification, and risk explanations.
- Offer cross-platform sync with end-to-end encryption.

## 8. Incident Response
- **Lost Device:** Trigger remote wipe, rotate keys, restore from backup.
- **Compromised Account:** Freeze spending via smart contract controls, notify custodial partners, initiate insurance claim.
- **Protocol Upgrade:** Prompt users to update clients, migrate to new address formats, and handle chain splits.

## 9. Analytics and Monitoring
- Track wallet health metrics: active addresses, approval statuses, failed transactions.
- Provide user dashboards for spending categories, governance participation, and staking performance.

## 10. Future Innovations
- Account abstraction with programmable policy engines.
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving compliance.
- Voice and gesture interfaces for inclusive access.

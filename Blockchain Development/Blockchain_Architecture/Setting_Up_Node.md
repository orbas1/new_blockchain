# Setting Up Node Guide (Doctoral Edition)

## 1. Overview
This guide prescribes the end-to-end procedure for provisioning, securing, and operating a blockchain node, covering validator, full node, and archive configurations. Emphasis is placed on reproducible infrastructure, security hardening, and observability.

## 2. Node Typologies
| Node Type | Purpose | Hardware Profile | Storage Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Light Client | Verify headers, rely on peers for data | Mobile/embedded | Header-only, on-demand proofs |
| Full Node | Validate transactions, serve RPC | 8-16 core CPU, 32-64 GB RAM | Pruned or rolling window |
| Validator | Participate in consensus | 16+ core CPU, 64+ GB RAM, HSM | High-availability SSD RAID |
| Archive | Historical state queries | 32+ core CPU, 256+ GB RAM | Petabyte-scale, object storage |

## 3. Pre-Requisites
- **Infrastructure:** Secure data center or cloud provider, redundant power/network, hardware security modules.
- **Software:** Hardened OS (Ubuntu LTS, Fedora Server), container runtime (Docker, Podman), configuration management (Ansible, Terraform).
- **Credentials:** Validator keys, API tokens, TLS certificates, SSH keys with hardware-backed MFA.

## 4. Deployment Steps
1. **Provision Infrastructure:** Use Terraform to allocate compute, network, and storage. Apply CIS benchmarks to base images.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Update packages, install build tools, configure firewall (ufw/nftables), and enable automatic security updates.
3. **Fetch Client Software:** Verify binaries via reproducible builds or compile from source using signed tags. Validate checksums and signatures (GPG, Minisign).
4. **Configure Node:** Set chain ID, data directories, pruning mode, telemetry endpoints, and seed peers. For validators, configure consensus keys and sentry architecture.
5. **Enable Observability:** Configure Prometheus exporters, OpenTelemetry tracing, log shipping to SIEM, and alert thresholds.
6. **Secure Key Material:** Store validator keys in HSM or remote signer, enforce role-based access control, and implement key rotation policies.
7. **Launch Services:** Use systemd, Kubernetes, or Nomad for process supervision. Configure health checks, auto-restart, and dependency ordering.

## 5. High Availability Patterns
- **Sentry Nodes:** Validators connect only to hardened sentry nodes; rotate sentries regularly.
- **Redundant Validators:** Maintain hot-standby with failover protocols and double-signing prevention (mutex locks, signing services).
- **Geo-Redundancy:** Deploy nodes across regions with latency-optimized connections, ensuring compliance with data residency.

## 6. Security Hardening
- Enforce least privilege via SELinux/AppArmor, seccomp profiles, and read-only file systems.
- Implement DDoS protection (Anycast, upstream scrubbing, rate limiting).
- Monitor for anomalous system calls, network flows, and consensus events.
- Conduct regular penetration tests and red team exercises focusing on validator capture.

## 7. Maintenance Operations
- **Upgrades:** Use canary nodes, review release notes, and follow governance-approved upgrade windows.
- **Backups:** Schedule encrypted snapshots, test restore procedures, and maintain off-site backups.
- **Log Management:** Retain logs per compliance requirements, ensure tamper evidence via append-only storage.
- **Capacity Scaling:** Monitor disk usage, CPU load, and memory; scale vertically or horizontally as needed.

## 8. Compliance Considerations
- Implement audit trails, configuration management databases (CMDB), and change management approvals.
- Maintain documentation for regulator inspections, including security policies and incident response plans.
- Ensure alignment with data privacy laws (GDPR), export controls, and taxation of validator rewards.

## 9. Troubleshooting Playbook
- **Sync Issues:** Check peer connectivity, adjust seeds, inspect logs for consensus mismatches, and re-run state sync.
- **Performance Degradation:** Analyze resource metrics, enable tracing, consider hardware upgrades or pruning adjustments.
- **Consensus Penalties:** Investigate missed blocks, review network logs, and coordinate with other validators for joint incident analysis.

## 10. Future Enhancements
- Adopt declarative node management (GitOps), automated compliance reporting, and self-healing orchestrations.
- Explore confidential computing for key isolation, zero-downtime upgrades, and AI-driven anomaly detection.
